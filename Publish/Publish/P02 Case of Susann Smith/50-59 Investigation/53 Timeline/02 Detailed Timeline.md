	- Based on the blood splatter evidence, it was apparent that [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] had initially been attacked while she had been in her bed.[^118]

		- Police later determined it would’ve taken approximately 17 minutes to fill the bathtub to the point that they had found it in.[^128] 
	- Due to the injuries that [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] had sustained to her face, the police were initially unable to positively identify her.[^129]

- The trial against [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] came to an end.[^442] 
- The trial court gave its oral decision to the parties, which included findings of fact and conclusions of law.[^379] 
- The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]‘s involvement in the crime.[^380] 
- In particular, the court found that at the time of [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]‘s death, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] obsessed with the dissolution, and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] frequently expressing his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members.[^381] 
- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also expressed concern that [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] would take their two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] back to her native Germany.[^382] 
- The trial court found that in the fall of 2012, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made statements to a woman he was involved with that he would like [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] to disappear, and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] asked the woman if she knew of anyway to “*get rid of*” someone.[^383] 
- At around the same time, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] and [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]] - items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene.[^384] 
- The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]] match to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on a washcloth located under [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]‘s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]].[^385] 
- The trial court noted in its oral findings that in the early morning hours of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]‘s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]‘s house.[^386] 
- Evidence was also presented that a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had recently purchased was later found abandoned near [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]‘s apartment complex.[^387] 
- The trial court also found that the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]] and [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]].[^388] 
- In particular, on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters.[^389] 
- On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]], masking tape, croc-style shoes with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police.[^390] 
- Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], and a modified search for flights for one adult after [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were placed with [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|Child Protective Services]].[^391]
- After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was guilty of the crime of murdering [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]], but that the evidence must be considered in light of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s interactions with [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] to whom [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] confessed. [^392] 
- The trial court concluded that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s confession to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]], in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was responsible for the murder of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]].[^393] 
- The Court convicted [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] of Murder in the First Degree after hearing the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict.[^394] 
- The sentencing hearing was scheduled for [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015|2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015]] at **1:30pm**.[^395] 

### [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2015-02-17 Tuesday February 17th 2015|2015-02-17 Tuesday February 17th 2015]]
- The State’s sentencing memorandum was filed prior to the sentencing of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]].[^396]
- This is what the State requested within the sentencing memorandum, they noted that:
	- Murder in the First Degree is a level XV offense.[^397] 
	- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had no prior criminal history, thus having an offender score of “0”.[^398] 
	- The standard range sentence for [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was 240 to 320 months.[^399] 
	- The Court found that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had been armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the offense.[^400] 
		- This finding adds 24 months to both the top and the bottom of the standard range, for an actual standard range of 264 to 244 months.[^401] 
	- The Court also found that this was a crime of Domestic Violence.[^402] 
		- This offense also carries 36 months of community custody.[^403] 
	- The State’s recommendation is that the Court sentence [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to the high end of the actual range, 344 months.[^404] 
	- In looking at the facts of this case it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence. [^405] 
	- This murder was no "heat of the moment" event. [^406] 
	- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] chose a time when [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] would least likely be able to defend herself, and when it was least likely that anyone would witness any part of the act and attempt to intervene.[^407] 
	- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] took multiple steps to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for police to find. [^408] 
	- Further, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] used his own [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] as props in his story to police, holding them forth as proof he did not venture out into the night and "*kill the mother of his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]]*".[^409] 
	- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s arrogance manifested itself in a belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned well enough he would be able to get away with murder. [^410] 
	- It would appear, from all the evidence in the case, that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] approached this vicious attack like he would have any problem at work; this is, with enough thought and engineering anything could be managed.[^411] 
	- The manner in which [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] planned the attack, and the manner in which [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body in the bathtub demonstrates this. [^412] 
	- [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] believed he had thought of everything - coming under the cover of darkness, wearing protective gear, disposing of the various items used in the attack, and having a story he believed could not be not be disproved. [^413] 
	- Ultimately, however, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was undone both by various items he did not account for, and by his own unravelling when his "post-Susann" life did not turn out as he anticipated.[^414] 
	- The degree to which [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s selfishness will impact the lives of [[../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s family and his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] is hard to overstate.[^415] 
	- In an effort to keep his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] from going with their mother to her native Germany, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] and church.[^416] 
	- Because he feared that the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] might be moved to Germany at some point, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] has essentially orphaned them. [^417] 
	- The grotesque manner in which [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] treated [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in the bathtub, speaks volumes as to the disdain he had for anyone's desires or wishes other than his own.[^418] 
	- The horrific scene that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left in blood at the home where his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] lived would seem clear evidence [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] thought of no one but himself.[^419] 
	- The cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] cannot be exaggerated. [^420] 
	- The Court saw the damage [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] inflicted on [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], so it will not be belaboured here.[^421] 
	- However, the location of the injuries, the number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the placement of her in the bathtub once she was completely helpless demonstrates a single mindedness of purpose on [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s part. [^422] 
	- The pain and horror that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate.[^423] 
	- The State would request that the Court impose the high end of the actual standard range of 344 months.[^424] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions.[^425] 
	- The State would also ask the Court to order [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to have no contact with Kristine Hentschel, Johanna and Werner Hentschel (all three are members of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]‘s family) for life.[^426] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court order no contact with either Noelani Smith and Felix Smith (the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]]) until they reach the age of 18, respectively.[^427]
