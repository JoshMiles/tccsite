[Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) then mentioned that divorce and child custody hearings could be very emotional and asked [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) if he had any reason to harm [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md). ^iyi9-

[Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) asked the question again, and then [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) said "I think I may need to talk to an attorney." ^1tclg

The detectives knocked on the door and shook [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s hand when he answered. ^ry8gy

Once inside the [apartment](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/05%20Apartment.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) indicated his displeasure that [CPS](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/08%20CPS.md) had custody of his [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md). ^e2vmb  
[Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) answered that both [CPS](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/08%20CPS.md) and the police were doing their job, to make sure the [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) were safe and not in any danger. ^7iadc  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then stated: "my attorney said I shouldn't talk to you". ^h3s4i

[Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) responded that it was [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s choice not to speak to detectives, but that the detectives were conducting an investigation of a serious matter, and were hopeful [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) could help them out with information regarding people who knew [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md). ^as6zv  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then indicated he would answer questions by stating "OK", and setting down. ^n4jqw

Police then inquired regarding a male neighbour of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s, [Mark Buckley](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/08%20Mark%20Buckley.md), whether the two could have been dating, and whether [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) was dating anyone to his knowledge. ^udyzo

The three discussed the nature of the relationship between [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) and [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md), and the general manner in which they communicated. ^wpvzv  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) eventually told the two detectives that he had been upset by the other night, and that he believed their (the detective's) job was "to traumatize me". ^ao4si

A short conversation ensued regarding [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s work, her nicknames, and his access to [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s house. ^496gc  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then stood up and told the detectives to leave. ^v3ro7  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) declined any further photos of his hand, and got extremely close to [Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md), to the extend that [Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) was concerned for his personal safety. ^m53k5  
Attempting to defuse the situation, [Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) asked about the [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md)'s carnival on [2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2013-02-09%20Saturday%20February%209th%202013.md). ^0d-yu  
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) briefly answered and told the police to leave again. ^5g3ri

The conversation ended when [Detective Stone](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/02%20Detective%20Stone.md) suggested that the person who had committed the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) must be feeling intense pain for their actions, and that person needed to know they could receive grace and mercy if that person was to turn themselves in and tell their side of the story. ^lb7ez

[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) nodded, then stated "I don't have anything else to say." ^zmas7
