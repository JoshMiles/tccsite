[Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) had not reported to work for the past two days and her employer called law enforcement for a welfare check. When officers entered the Smith House, they found an individual, later identified as [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md), face down in the bath tub.

Officers learned that [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) and [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) were in the process of getting a divorce and went to meet with [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) at work.

[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) returned to Washington on [2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2013-02-09%20Saturday%20February%209th%202013.md) at 12:00pm.

[Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) was having a Fasching (a German version of Mardi Gras) party. A number of [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) from the neighbourhood were present. While at the house, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) went into the kitchen, two bedrooms, the hallway, the bathroom and the living room. [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) went with his son to the restroom.

When police searched [The Smith House](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/02%20The%20Smith%20House.md), they located a camera. They viewed the pictures on the camera. The pictures were of the party [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) had at [The Smith House](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/02%20The%20Smith%20House.md) on [2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2013-02-09%20Saturday%20February%209th%202013.md). The pictures show the condition of the home on [2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2013-02-09%20Saturday%20February%209th%202013.md), including the bathroom where [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) was found. ^ti2ld

She spoke to a friend from Germany on the phone. She went to Choir practice and then met up with [Ani Gothard-Williams](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/05%20Ani%20Gothard-Williams.md) to see The Music Man in Seattle. [Mrs Gothard-Williams](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/05%20Ani%20Gothard-Williams.md) and [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) met up at the theatre.

After the show, [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) dropped Mrs. Gothard-Williams off at her home. [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) returned to [The Smith House](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/02%20The%20Smith%20House.md) sometime before 10:30pm.

[Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) came over and started talking to [Mr Buckley](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/06%20Mr%20Buckley.md). The conversation was quick and she returned home. ^asip5

After going inside, [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) did not go to bed immediately.

## Dr. Davenport Testimony & Bike Sighting

Law enforcement viewed various [traffic cameras](../../60-69%20Evidence/61%20Digital/01%20CCTV.md) to look for vehicles belonging to [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) on the night of [2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2013-02-10%20Sunday%20February%2010th%202013.md) or early morning of [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md).  
While they did not see any vehicles that matched the description of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s vehicles, they did notice what appeared to be a [bicycle](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) traveling in the early morning hours of [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md).  
In the same images that showed the bike, a Pete's coffee truck was visible. ^7y10o

Law enforcement tracked down the [truck driver](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) and asked him about seeing a bicyclist. ^2pkzb  
The interview took place on [2013-06-14 Friday June 14th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-06-14%20Friday%20June%2014th%202013.md), four months later, and was recorded. ^2vue5

During the interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md), the [truck driver](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md), said that he remembered seeing a man on a bike one night in February. ^qg81n  
He did not remember the exact date, but said it was a Monday. ^za3c7

He said he only glanced at the man on the bike twice. ^m-xv2

During the [2013-06-14 Friday June 14th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-06-14%20Friday%20June%2014th%202013.md) interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) described the man as wearing dark clothing with a grizzled or unkempt look. ^9v173

[Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) failed to mention any specific article of clothing or any specific features of the bicyclist such as race, age, height, weight, hair colour, heigh lengths or style, facial hair, or shape of face, eyes, nose, or chin. ^ltznh

On [2014-09-17 September 17th 2014](2014-09-17%20September%2017th%202014.md), 19 months later, [Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) met with defence investigator Kathy McCall. In this second interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) stated he can identify the man he saw on the bike on that Monday morning as [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md). [Mr Cain](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/02%20Truck%20Driver.md) admitted that he followed the news stories in the case and had viewed pictures of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) in the news.

The defence intends to call Dr. Jennifer Davenport to testify on witness identification. Dr. Davenport will testify about factors that exist in this case that negatively impact eyewitness reliability.
