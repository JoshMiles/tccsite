[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was serving his #sentence at Coyote Ridge Corrections Centre in [Connel, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connell,_Washington) in 2022.

#Evidence presented at trial established that the man riding the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] had been observed on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], not [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]].

#Evidence presented established that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] stopped in the Albertson's parking lot near some dumpsters on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], not [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]].

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2017-01-09 Monday January 9th 2017|2017-01-09 Monday January 9th 2017]], the Court of Appeals issued an unpublished opinion that affirmed [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s conviction following his #appeal. ^14w94

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] filed a pro se petition for review with the Washington #Supreme Court, which was denied for review without comment on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2017-08-02 Wednesday August 2nd 2017|2017-08-02 Wednesday August 2nd 2017]]. ^25nj5

The Washington Court of Appeals issued its mandate terminating direct review on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2017-08-11 Friday August 11th 2017|2017-08-11 Friday August 11th 2017]]. ^vkc0d

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2016-06-12 Monday June 13th 2016|2016-06-12 Monday June 13th 2016]], while his direct appeal was pending, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Washington #Supreme Court.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] waived his right to a jury trial, the verdict in his case rendered by the trial court itself. ^dc0d1

The trial court gave its oral decision to the parties on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2015-02-04 Wednesday February 4th 2015|2015-02-04 Wednesday February 4th 2015]], which included detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. ^3fp2r

The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s involvement in the crime. ^56wi2

In particular, the court found that at the time of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death in [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02 February 2013|2013-02 February 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] obsessed with the dissolution, and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] frequently expressed his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members. ^mb3r6

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also expressed concern that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] would take their two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] back to her native Germany. ^rjc9s

The trial court found that in the [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012 Fall 2012|2012 Fall 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made statements to a women he was involved with that he would like [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] to disappear, and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] asked the woman if she knew of anyway to "get rid of" someone. ^nlvp7

At around the same time, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] and [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]], items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene. ^n-818

The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]] match to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on a washcloth located under [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]. ^3crj0

And, in its oral findings, the trial court noted that, in the early morning hours of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s home. ^pcl2v
Evidence was also presented that a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had recently purchased was later found abandoned in a ravine near [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] complex. ^dq6od

The trial court also found that [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]] and [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. ^6jn7m

In particular, on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters. ^zzzgl

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]], masking tape, [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/06 Croc-style Shoes|croc-style shoes]] with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police. ^f5n1i

Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], and a modified search for flights for one adult after [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were placed with [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|Child Protective Services]]. ^csezh

After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was guilty of the crime of murdering [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], but that the evidence must be considered in light of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s interactions with [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] to whom [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] confessed. ^dnko1

The trial court concluded that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s confession to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]], in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was responsible for the murder of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^0xg6r

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] argued that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But following a conviction, the evidence is viewed in a light most favourable to the State, with all reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence viewed in a manner supporting the prosecution.

Here, the evidence showed that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had expressed a desire to get rid of the victim because of acrimonious divorce, he had purchased items consistent with the murder weapon and evidence found at the scene, a man was seen riding a bike near the scene of the murder and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s bike was later located nearby, and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made internet searches for flights to Venezuela after he was notified of the death.

Viewed in the light most favourable to the prosecution, taken together and drawing all inferences in favour of the State, this evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] argued against the various aspects of his confession to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] and whether the confession was properly admitted into evidence at trial.

In particular, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] asserts that the police acted improperly in obtaining the confession, and that the confession was improperly admitted into evidence without a determination of voluntariness.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also asserts that admission of the confession violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause and other unspecified state rules of evidence.

The Court observes that prior to trial, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] south to have his statements to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] suppressed only on the grounds that the statements were protected from disclosure by the clergy-penitent privilege. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing after which it concluded that the asserted privilege did not apply.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] argued on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the statements, but the Court of Appeals rejected that argument.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also offered a myriad of other arguments as to why his statements to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] should not have been admitted, including those identified here in the context of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s sufficiency of the evidence claim, and the state courts consistently rejected those arguments.

In addition to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s challenges to the admissibility of his confession, he also takes issue with two statements in the Supreme Court [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|Commissioner]]'s decision that he claims are erroneous.

The statements at issue did not appear in the discussion of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s sufficiency of the evidence claim but, instead, appeared in the portion of [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]'s ruling setting forth the underlying facts relevant to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s asserted claims.

The first challenged statement is:

> "Witnesses reported seeing a man riding a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] near [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home in the early morning on the day she was murdered."

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] suggests that this statement is erroneous because it is inconsistent with the defence theory as to when [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was murdered. The statement, however, is consistent with the State's theory of when the crime occurred and, as noted above, the Court views all evidence in the light most favourable to the State in conducting its sufficiency review. 

**The fact that the statement was inconsistent with the defence theory is therefore irrelevant.**

The second challenged statement is:

> "Data retrieved from a [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] device in [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] revealed that on the day [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was discovered, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had stopped by some dumpsters in a grocery store parking lot after dropping the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] off at school."

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] contends that the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data showed he stopped in a grocery store parking lot but did not show him near the dumpsters.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also contends that the evidence showed the stop in the grocery store parking lot occurred on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]] and not [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. However, this inaccuracy does not undermine [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]'s conclusion with respect to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s sufficiency of the evidence claim.

With respect to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s claim that the evidence did not show he stopped near the dumpsters, the Court again notes that [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]] did not reference this fact in disposing of the claim.

Ultimately, none of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s arguments demonstrate that the Washington Supreme Court [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|Commissioner]]'s resolution of his sufficiency of the evidence claim is contract to, or constitutes an unreasonable application of, United States Supreme Court law.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] claims that police initiated the seizure and detention of his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] several months prior to his arrest in order to coerce [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s cooperation in their investigation and obtain an incriminating statement.

The Washington Court of Appeals considered and rejected [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s challenge to the admissibility of his statements to law enforcement in [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s personal restraint proceedings. 

The Court of Appeals explained its conclusion as follows:

> [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] next contends that his confession to law enforcement should have been inadmissible because it was obtained through coercion. He contends that he cooperated with law enforcement investigation because detectives told him that his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were in [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|Child Protective Services]] ([[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]]) custody and that "[a] reasonable person would not consider himself free to ignore police requests for information under the circumstances."

> [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] drove to [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] to talk with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], the date of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death. They interviewed [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] for approximately 25-30 minutes until one of them asked [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] if he had any reason to harm his wife and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] requested an attorney. The detectives ceased questioning him and told him he was free to leave.

>[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went back to his office and one of the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] called his commander, who stated that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were being placed in [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]] custody. The detectives then informed [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]] was taking custody of his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] and he could obtain the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]] paperwork at the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] Police Department.

>[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to the police department. En route, he called the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] phone and authorized a search of his [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] and [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]], and offered to voluntarily give a [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]] sample. The searches took place that evening. At the conclusion of the search, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] gave another hour-long interview to the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]].

> On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-16 Saturday February 16th 2013|2013-02-16 Saturday February 16th 2013]], the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] visited [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] again. A detective told [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]] would retain the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] until [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was cleared in the murder investigation. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] willingly spoke with [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] for some time but eventually became agitated and told the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] to leave.

> On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-22 Friday February 22nd 2013|2013-02-22 Friday February 22nd 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] returned to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] to serve search warrants and talked with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] for approximately an hour. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] ended the interview, stating "I don't have anything else to say"

> On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-03-08 Friday March 8th 2013|2013-03-08 Friday March 8th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went to the police department to retrieve the keys to his [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]]. The [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] asked if they could question [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] further. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] refused to answer any questions on the advise of his attorney. ^8csm4

>On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-27 Thursday June 27th 2013|2013-06-27 Thursday June 27th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] contacted [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and told him they had spoken to [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated that he did not want to speak to the [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]]. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was arrested and read his Miranda rights.

>Following a CrR 3.5 hearing, the trial court found that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was not in custody on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-16 Saturday February 16th 2013|2013-02-16 Saturday February 16th 2013]] or [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-22 Friday February 22nd 2013|2013-02-22 Friday February 22nd 2013]] because a reasonable person in [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s position would not have believed he was in custody.

>A [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|defendant]]'s statements made in a noncustodial setting are voluntary and therefore admissible if, under the totality of the circumstances, the statement was not coerced.

>Hence, there is nothing in the record indicating that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s free will was overcome by the fact that his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were in [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]] custody. On several occasions, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] felt free to terminate questioning by [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/03 Detectives|Detectives]] and indeed did so. There was substantial evidence that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s statements to detectives were voluntary.
