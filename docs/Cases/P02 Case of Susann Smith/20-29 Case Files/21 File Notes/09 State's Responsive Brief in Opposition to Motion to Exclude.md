[John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md) was [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s lawyer during her dissolution proceedings with [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md). After [Commissioner](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/02%20Commissioner.md) Brudvik had made her initial rulings on Temporary Orders related to the divorce on [2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2012-08-03%20Friday%20August%203rd%202012.md), the parties and their respective lawyers went out into the hall to reduce [the Commissioner](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/02%20Commissioner.md)'s rulings to writing. ^jhnjt

While this was going on, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) and [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) disagreed on an issue relating to time with the [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) during the summer. According to attorney [John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) got upset; and then fixed upon [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) what he described as an "incredibly angry" stare. [John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md) describes the stare as lasting approximately 5 seconds. [John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md) indicated in his written statement to police that the stare was something the like he had never seen in some 15 years of practise. The glare was concerning enough to [John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md) that he asked [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) about it, and mentioned it to his staff. ^zeg12

The State would ask the Court to deny [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s motion to exclude this testimony from attorney [John Ely](../../70-79%20People/77%20Legal%20Teams/01%20John%20Ely.md).
