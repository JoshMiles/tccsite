[Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) and [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)

The girlfriend of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md), the [Bothell](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/04%20Bothell.md) man accused of killing his estranged wife early last year, died [2014-04-08 Monday April 8th 2014](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2014-04-08%20Monday%20April%208th%202014.md) in [Seattle](geo:47.6038321,-122.330062). ^1lccy

According to the King County Medical Examiner’s Office, [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) committed suicide.
Marks around her neck indicate she died from a rope or something around her neck. ^oongz

Thai lived at Pacific Court in [Tukwila](geo:47.4627356,-122.2559156). The [apartment](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/05%20Apartment.md) manager could not confirm if [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) had died in her home.

[Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) told the _Reporter_ in [2013-07 July 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-07%20July%202013.md) she was pregnant with [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)’s child and there was an ultrasound photo posted to her personal Facebook account around the same time. ^4148p
The medical examiner’s office could not confirm if [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md)  was still pregnant at the time of her death. ^taqjm

Lawyers for [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) asked a judge to push back his murder trial this week so they could have more time to prepare.
[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)’s trial date was moved from [2014-05-02 Friday May 2nd 2014](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2014-05-02%20Friday%20May%202nd%202014.md) to [2014-06-13 Friday June 13th 2014](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2014-06-13%20Friday%20June%2013th%202014.md), according to Craig Matheson, senior deputy prosecuting attorney at Snohomish County Prosectors Office. ^hb6x1

“While certainly tragic, I don’t think [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md)'s death will affect the trial at all,” Matheson said.

[Alan Smith](../../70-79%2520People/72%2520Suspects%2520and%2520People%2520of%2520Interest/01%2520Alan%2520Smith.md.md#.md#), who plead not guilty in [2013-07 July 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-07%20July%202013.md), [is accused of killing his estranged wife](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/194405941.html) last February and sits in the Snohomish County Jail on $1 million bail. [Alan Smith](../../70-79%2520People/72%2520Suspects%2520and%2520People%2520of%2520Interest/01%2520Alan%2520Smith.md.md#.md#) is accused of murdering his wife [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md), who was found on[2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), face down, beaten and drown to death in the bathtub of her [Bothell](../../50-59%20Investigation/52%20Key%20Locations/04%20Bothell.md) home while her two [kids](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md)(../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md#) were away, according to court documents.

[Alan Smith](../../70-79%2520People/72%2520Suspects%2520and%2520People%2520of%2520Interest/01%2520Alan%2520Smith.md.md#.md#) [moved back into the home](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/204131081.html) with [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) in [2013-04 April 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-04%20April%202013.md) and had hopes of regaining custody of his two young [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md), who had been taken by Washington State [Child Protective Services](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/08%20CPS.md)(../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#). ^qdarf

[Alan Smith and Thai seemed to have a rocky relationship](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/208901791.html) as police were called to [Alan Smith](../../70-79%2520People/72%2520Suspects%2520and%2520People%2520of%2520Interest/01%2520Alan%2520Smith.md.md#.md#)’s home for various incidents during May 2013, including a report of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) and [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) having sex in the front yard and for a domestic disturbance.

[When Alan Smith was charged](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/213571071.html)[2013-06-28 Friday June 28th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-06-28%20Friday%20June%2028th%202013.md), he said his life was in “chaos.” He stated that he was over his head “with [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) and her mental issues,” according to charging documents. ^9wx16

When [Alan Smith](../../70-79%2520People/72%2520Suspects%2520and%2520People%2520of%2520Interest/01%2520Alan%2520Smith.md.md#.md#) appeared in court [2013-09-23 Monday September 23rd 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2013-09-23%20Monday%20September%2023rd%202013.md) on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction, [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md), was there to defend him. ^bt6bq
At the time, the two lived together in the home where [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) was killed.

“I feel absolutely safe — absolutely. We argue, we throw things, but we don’t hurt each other,” [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) said at the time.

She also believed that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) was capable of killing.

“I don’t know what his threshold is,” she said. “Is the possibility and the capability there? Yes.”

But she said she was in love and trusted [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) completely.

“He said he did not do it,” [Love Thai](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/02%20Love%20Thai.md) said. “So, I stand by him and the truth will always set people free.”

[Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) and his attorney could not be reached for comment.
