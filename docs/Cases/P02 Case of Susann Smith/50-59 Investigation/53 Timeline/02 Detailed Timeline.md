	- It’s important to note that this offer was not in response to any request from the police.[^173] 
	- Police accepted [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s offer and obtained two separate [DNA](../../60-69%20Evidence/62%20Forensic/04%20DNA.md) samples of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s saliva.[^174] 
- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then volunteered to provide a tape recorded statement (see below).[^175]

- This taped statement started at **8:42pm** and ended at **9:35pm**.[^176] 
	- During this tape statement, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) described the earlier interview with police at the [Boeing](../52%20Key%20Locations/01%20Boeing.md) plant, how he reinitiated contact with police, volunteered to a search of his [car](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/04%20Car.md) and [apartment](../52%20Key%20Locations/05%20Apartment.md), and consented to the taking of buccal swabs for [DNA](../../60-69%20Evidence/62%20Forensic/04%20DNA.md).[^177] 
	- At the conclusion of the taped statement, the police bade [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) good night and left.[^178]

	- This was determined to have been a highly unusual text.[^202] 
- The Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) from the Washington State Patrol arrived at approximately **8:00pm**, and worked through the next several days in processing the death scene.[^225]  I’m going to sum up what they determined here for simplicity’s sake.
	- The assault on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) started in her bedroom.[^226] 
	- She was bludgeoned on her bed, the floor, and then dragged to the bathroom and placed in the bathtub.[^227] 
	- [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) ultimately drowned in the bathtub.[^228] 
	- The blood splatter in the bedroom, hallway, and bathroom was extensive.[^229] 
	- Throughout the blood stains in the hallway, there were a number of both footwear impressions and footprint impressions.[^230] 
	- The bloody footwear/footprint impressions led into the kitchen area of the house, and through the front living room towards the front door.[^231] 
	- There were several very clear footprint impressions and footwear impressions left in the blood matrix in several locations in the house.[^232] 
	- The scene was processed methodically by the CSRT.[^233] 
	- Blood splatter, blood cast off, and other types of blood evidence were documented, both as found initially, and then as various pieces of furniture were removed to fully reveal the blood evidence.[^234] 
	- A number of photographs were also taken of the blood footprints.[^235] 
	- The CSRT took a large number of swabs from various bloody areas of the home, and took a number of physical items into evidence.[^236] 
	- [Kris Kern](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/01%20Kris%20Kern.md) of the Washington State Police, an expert in crime scene reconstruction and bloodstain pattern analysis, led the team that processed the home.[^237] 
	- [Kern](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/01%20Kris%20Kern.md) also authored a detailed report outling the sequencing of the brutal assault on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#), the dynamic nature of the assault, and the dragging of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s body to the bathtub. [^238] 
	- [Steve Stone](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/02%20Steve%20Stone.md), a forensic scientist at Washington State Police, examined some of the footwear impressions left in the blood.[^239] 
	- A type of shoe, the [croc-style shoes](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/06%20Croc-style%20Shoes.md) that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had purchased was “*consistent*” with leaving some of the prints at the scene - according to [Steve Stone](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/02%20Steve%20Stone.md).[^240] 
	- [Steve Stone](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/02%20Steve%20Stone.md) also examined some bloodstain impressions on the bathtub.[^241] 
		- [Stone](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/02%20Steve%20Stone.md) found that the impressions in blood on the tub were “*consistent*” with a [coveralls](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) type of suit that the police had uncovered [autopsy](../../60-69%20Evidence/62%20Forensic/01%20Autopsy.md) purchasing on [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md) and [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md).[^242] 
	- [Sergeant Shelly Massey](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/03%20Sergeant%20Shelly%20Massey.md) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was consulted by the [Bothell](../52%20Key%20Locations/04%20Bothell.md) Police Department in regards to the bloody footprints. [^243] 
		- [Sergeant Massey](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/03%20Sergeant%20Shelly%20Massey.md) is an expert on **foot morphology**.[^244] 
		- [Sergeant Massey](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/03%20Sergeant%20Shelly%20Massey.md) examined photos of the bloody footprints, and compared them to known impressions of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s feet, and found *support* for the hypothesis that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) left the bloody footprints.[^245] 
	- [Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md), assistant medical examiner for Snohomish County, responded to [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s home, and examined the body in situ prior to it being removed to the medical examiner’s office.[^247]

- The [GPS](../../60-69%20Evidence/61%20Digital/02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicated that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) left his home at **4:25am** and headed south on I-405, exiting 405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on I-405.[^210] 
- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then continued back north on 405, ultimately ending his journey at the [Boeing](../52%20Key%20Locations/01%20Boeing.md) plant at **5:29am**.[^211] 
	- His arrival was confirmed by [Boeing](../52%20Key%20Locations/01%20Boeing.md) security pass records.[^212] 
- It is unknown why [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) drove to Renton in the early hours of the morning[^214] however, it is clear that that drive had been unprecedented based on the data stored in the [GPS](../../60-69%20Evidence/61%20Digital/02%20Garmin%20GPS.md).[^215] 
- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) began to search the internet for flights to South America at **5:53am**.[^213] 
- At **6:06am**, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) performed a search on Kayak.com looking for flight information from Seattle to Venezuela for only 1 adult.[^209] 
- During the day, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) made four separate cash withdrawals from an ATM at [Boeing](../52%20Key%20Locations/01%20Boeing.md)[^216] with the total amount of $1,500.[^217] 
- The Snohomish Count Medical Examiner’s Office conducted an [autopsy](../../60-69%20Evidence/62%20Forensic/01%20Autopsy.md) on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s body.[^218] 
	- The pathologist ([Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md)[^246] ) discovered:[^219] 
		- Multiple injuries to her head and face: 12 sharp force injuries and 10 blunt force injuries.[^220] [^248] 
		- The blunt force blows caused a skull fracture that would have caused [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s death, however, it was apparent that [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) had still been alive when she was placed in the bathtub.[^221] 
		- The medical examiner discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) had drowned while face down in the tub.[^222] 
		- Other than a number of defensive bruises on her forearms and hands, [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) had no injuries other than the 22 blows and cuts to her head.[^223] 
		- **No evidence of sexual assault was found**.
		- [Dr Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) also documented a number of injuries to both of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s arms that he termed “*defensive wounds*”.[^249] 
		- The autopsy was photo documented as per the usual protocol.[^253] 
	- The significance of [Dr Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md)' findings was, among other things, that two different weapons were used to kill [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#).[^250] 
	- [Dr Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) was shown a type of [mallet](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/03%20Mallet.md) that the police learnt [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had bought on [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md).[^251] 
	- [Dr Adams](../../70-79%20People/76%20Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) opined that this type of weapon would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#).[^252]

	- It was also apparent from looking at the location of the various wounds on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s body that the sole intent of her assailant had been to kill her.[^255]

- The trial against [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) came to an end.[^442] 
- The trial court gave its oral decision to the parties, which included findings of fact and conclusions of law.[^379] 
- The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s involvement in the crime.[^380] 
- In particular, the court found that at the time of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s death, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) and [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) obsessed with the dissolution, and [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) frequently expressing his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members.[^381] 
- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) also expressed concern that [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) would take their two [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) back to her native Germany.[^382] 
- The trial court found that in the fall of 2012, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) made statements to a woman he was involved with that he would like [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#) to disappear, and [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) asked the woman if she knew of anyway to “*get rid of*” someone.[^383] 
- At around the same time, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/03%20Mallet.md) and [disposable coveralls](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) - items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene.[^384] 
- The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [DNA](../../60-69%20Evidence/62%20Forensic/04%20DNA.md) match to [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) on a washcloth located under [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md).[^385] 
- The trial court noted in its oral findings that in the early morning hours of [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md), a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)‘s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s house.[^386] 
- Evidence was also presented that a [bicycle](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had recently purchased was later found abandoned near [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)‘s apartment complex.[^387] 
- The trial court also found that the [GPS](../../60-69%20Evidence/61%20Digital/02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) on [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md) and [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md).[^388] 
- In particular, on the morning of [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters.[^389] 
- On [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [disposable coveralls](../../60-69%20Evidence/63%20Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md), masking tape, croc-style shoes with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police.[^390] 
- Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) on the morning of [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/12%20Crime%20Dates/2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), and a modified search for flights for one adult after [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) were placed with [Child Protective Services](../../70-79%20People/75%20Police%20and%20Detectives/08%20CPS.md).[^391]
- After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) was guilty of the crime of murdering [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#), but that the evidence must be considered in light of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s interactions with [Wendell Morris](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/01%20Wendell%20Morris.md) to whom [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) confessed. [^392] 
- The trial court concluded that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s confession to [Wendell Morris](../../70-79%20People/74%20Witnesses/01%20Wendell%20Morris.md), in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) was responsible for the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md).[^393] 
- The Court convicted [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) of Murder in the First Degree after hearing the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict.[^394] 
- The sentencing hearing was scheduled for [2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2015-02-23%20Monday%20February%2023rd%202015.md) at **1:30pm**.[^395] 

### [2015-02-17 Tuesday February 17th 2015](../../10-19%20Case%20Dates/13%20Investigation%20Dates/2015-02-17%20Tuesday%20February%2017th%202015.md)
- The State’s sentencing memorandum was filed prior to the sentencing of [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md).[^396]
- This is what the State requested within the sentencing memorandum, they noted that:
	- Murder in the First Degree is a level XV offense.[^397] 
	- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had no prior criminal history, thus having an offender score of “0”.[^398] 
	- The standard range sentence for [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) was 240 to 320 months.[^399] 
	- The Court found that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had been armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the offense.[^400] 
		- This finding adds 24 months to both the top and the bottom of the standard range, for an actual standard range of 264 to 244 months.[^401] 
	- The Court also found that this was a crime of Domestic Violence.[^402] 
		- This offense also carries 36 months of community custody.[^403] 
	- The State’s recommendation is that the Court sentence [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) to the high end of the actual range, 344 months.[^404] 
	- In looking at the facts of this case it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence. [^405] 
	- This murder was no "heat of the moment" event. [^406] 
	- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) chose a time when [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) would least likely be able to defend herself, and when it was least likely that anyone would witness any part of the act and attempt to intervene.[^407] 
	- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) took multiple steps to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for police to find. [^408] 
	- Further, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) used his own [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) as props in his story to police, holding them forth as proof he did not venture out into the night and "*kill the mother of his [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md)*".[^409] 
	- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s arrogance manifested itself in a belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned well enough he would be able to get away with murder. [^410] 
	- It would appear, from all the evidence in the case, that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) approached this vicious attack like he would have any problem at work; this is, with enough thought and engineering anything could be managed.[^411] 
	- The manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) planned the attack, and the manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body in the bathtub demonstrates this. [^412] 
	- [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) believed he had thought of everything - coming under the cover of darkness, wearing protective gear, disposing of the various items used in the attack, and having a story he believed could not be not be disproved. [^413] 
	- Ultimately, however, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) was undone both by various items he did not account for, and by his own unravelling when his "post-Susann" life did not turn out as he anticipated.[^414] 
	- The degree to which [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s selfishness will impact the lives of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%2520People/71%2520Victim(s)/01%2520Susann%2520Smith.md.md#)'s family and his [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) is hard to overstate.[^415] 
	- In an effort to keep his [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) from going with their mother to her native Germany, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) went to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) and church.[^416] 
	- Because he feared that the [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) might be moved to Germany at some point, [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) has essentially orphaned them. [^417] 
	- The grotesque manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) treated [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in the bathtub, speaks volumes as to the disdain he had for anyone's desires or wishes other than his own.[^418] 
	- The horrific scene that [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) left in blood at the home where his [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md) lived would seem clear evidence [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) thought of no one but himself.[^419] 
	- The cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) cannot be exaggerated. [^420] 
	- The Court saw the damage [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) inflicted on [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md), so it will not be belaboured here.[^421] 
	- However, the location of the injuries, the number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the placement of her in the bathtub once she was completely helpless demonstrates a single mindedness of purpose on [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s part. [^422] 
	- The pain and horror that [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate.[^423] 
	- The State would request that the Court impose the high end of the actual standard range of 344 months.[^424] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions.[^425] 
	- The State would also ask the Court to order [Alan Smith](../../70-79%20People/72%20Suspects%20and%20People%20of%20Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) to have no contact with Kristine Hentschel, Johanna and Werner Hentschel (all three are members of [Susann Smith](../../70-79%20People/71%20Victim(s)/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)‘s family) for life.[^426] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court order no contact with either Noelani Smith and Felix Smith (the [children](../../70-79%20People/73%20Family%20and%20Friends/07%20Children.md)) until they reach the age of 18, respectively.[^427]
