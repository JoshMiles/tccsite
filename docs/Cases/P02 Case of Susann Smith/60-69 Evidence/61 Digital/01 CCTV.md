A check of surveillance video ([CCTV](01%20CCTV.md)) on the route from [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) to [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home (1.7 miles each way) located a biker coming from the direction of [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) at 2:24am in the early morning hours of [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md). The quality of the video is such that one can say little more than it is an individual on a [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md). A check of [traffic cameras](01%20CCTV.md) located a biker eastbound of 240th St. make a left hand turn (northbound) onto the [Bothell](04%20Bothell.md)-Everett Highway at 4:13am. This would be the most direct route from [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home to [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](05%20Apartment.md). Once again, the quality is such that little can be said other than that it shows a person on a [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md).

The time frame that the various cameras ([CCTV](01%20CCTV.md)) show a bicyclist on the route to and from [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) is consistent with the time frame police believe the murder occurred. Police believe [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) may have left his [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) unattended and unsecured in the hopes that it would be stolen, this disposing of it as possible evidence.

Police were able to confirm that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) did in fact stop at Walmart via surveillance video ([CCTV](01%20CCTV.md)) and receipts.
