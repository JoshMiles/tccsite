Police began a search of [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [car](04%20Car.md) at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had a [Garmin](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) portable [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md).


Police also served a warrant on the [Garmin GPS](01%20Garmin%20GPS.md) in [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [car](04%20Car.md). An analysis of the data from the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) device showed that on [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) travelled to the area of the 23200 block of 2rd Ave. SE (location of Little Bears Day-care, where his [children](07%20Children.md) went) at 7:54am, and then travelled to the location of the Albertson's parking lot located at 12811 Beverly Park Rd., in Lynnwood, arriving at 8:10am, and not leaving until 8:20am.

The [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) located the [car](04%20Car.md) in the northwest side of the parking lot. Two large dumpsters are located at this location. Police theorize that this is where [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) may have disposed of various bloody items related to the murder of [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md).

The [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) then indicated [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) drove to work. According to the data from the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md), the stop at the Albertson's parking lot is not a normal stop for [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md), and it is a stop he neglected to tell police about.

The following day, [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicated that, as [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) told police, he left [Boeing](01%20Boeing.md) plant at approximately 1:15pm. The data indicates that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then drove to the 11300 block of Evergreen Way, Everett, arriving at 1:21pm, and leaving at 1:35pm. This is the location of the Everett Walmart.

Following the purchase of the shoes, gloves, and gas can, the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicated that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) drove to the 11915 Highway 99, the location of the Home Depot.

[Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) admitted purchasing two [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md) at Home Depot at this time.

After [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s departure from Home Depot, the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicates that he drove to [Bothell](04%20Bothell.md), arriving at the intersection of 240th St SE and Meridian Ave South at 2:00pm.

This intersection is several blocks from [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home.

At the time [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s purpose was in going to the area of [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home on [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), but it is known that at that time he had in his [car](04%20Car.md) two packages of [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md), a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [croc style shoes](06%20Croc-style%20Shoes.md).

After reaching the barricade, the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicates that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) drove back to work at [Boeing](01%20Boeing.md), arriving there at 2:47pm - 15 minutes before detectives arrived.

The morning following the purchases at Walmart and Home Depot, [2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013](2013-02-13%20Wednesday%20February%2013th%202013.md), the [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data indicates that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) left his home at 4:25am and headed south on I-405, exiting 405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on I-405.

The [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) data shows that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) then continued back north on 405, ultimately ending his journey at the [Boeing](01%20Boeing.md) plant at 5:29am. His arrival at [Boeing](01%20Boeing.md) was confirmed by [Boeing](01%20Boeing.md) security pass records.
