Police began a search of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[04 Car|car]] at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had a [[02 Garmin GPS|Garmin]] portable [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]].


Police also served a warrant on the [[01 Garmin GPS|Garmin GPS]] in [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[04 Car|car]]. An analysis of the data from the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] device showed that on [[2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] travelled to the area of the 23200 block of 2rd Ave. SE (location of Little Bears Day-care, where his [[07 Children|children]] went) at 7:54am, and then travelled to the location of the Albertson's parking lot located at 12811 Beverly Park Rd., in Lynnwood, arriving at 8:10am, and not leaving until 8:20am.

The [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] located the [[04 Car|car]] in the northwest side of the parking lot. Two large dumpsters are located at this location. Police theorize that this is where [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] may have disposed of various bloody items related to the murder of [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]].

The [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] then indicated [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to work. According to the data from the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]], the stop at the Albertson's parking lot is not a normal stop for [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], and it is a stop he neglected to tell police about.

The following day, [[2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicated that, as [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] told police, he left [[01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant at approximately 1:15pm. The data indicates that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then drove to the 11300 block of Evergreen Way, Everett, arriving at 1:21pm, and leaving at 1:35pm. This is the location of the Everett Walmart.

Following the purchase of the shoes, gloves, and gas can, the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicated that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to the 11915 Highway 99, the location of the Home Depot.

[[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] admitted purchasing two [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] at Home Depot at this time.

After [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s departure from Home Depot, the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that he drove to [[04 Bothell|Bothell]], arriving at the intersection of 240th St SE and Meridian Ave South at 2:00pm.

This intersection is several blocks from [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home.

At the time [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s purpose was in going to the area of [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home on [[2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], but it is known that at that time he had in his [[04 Car|car]] two packages of [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]], a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [[06 Croc-style Shoes|croc style shoes]].

After reaching the barricade, the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove back to work at [[01 Boeing|Boeing]], arriving there at 2:47pm - 15 minutes before detectives arrived.

The morning following the purchases at Walmart and Home Depot, [[2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]], the [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left his home at 4:25am and headed south on I-405, exiting 405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on I-405.

The [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data shows that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then continued back north on 405, ultimately ending his journey at the [[01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant at 5:29am. His arrival at [[01 Boeing|Boeing]] was confirmed by [[01 Boeing|Boeing]] security pass records.
