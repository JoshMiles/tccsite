[Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md) was observed to have contusions to both of her arms and hands that were consistent with defensive wounds. There were no sharp force wounds to any other parts of [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body besides her face and head. There were no injuries to the torso and legs. The [autopsy](01%20Autopsy.md) revealed the victim had water in her lungs and airway consistent with drowning. [^1]

**Dr. Adams determined the cause of death was blunt force and sharp force trauma with a third component of asphyxiation by drowning.** [^1]
