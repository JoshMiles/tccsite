#Evidence 

The blood evidence in the bedroom indicated that the assault started while the victim was in bed before graduating to the right side of the bed and then the floor. The blood evidence further indicated that there were breaks in the assault and then the assault continued on the same victim. The blood pattern and blood smearing on the floor made it evident that the victim was moved in a dragging fashion out of the bedroom into the hallway and into the bathroom. There was evidence that there had been an attempt to wipe up the blood in the room, hallway and the bedroom.[^1]

There were observed several bloody finger type impressions throughout the house which did not show ridge detail. This was an indication that the suspect may have been wearing protective gloves during the commission of the crime. [^1]

The police requested the assistance of the Washing State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) in processing the death scene. During the processing of the home police discovered a number of footprints left in blood in various locations in the house. Some of these bloody footprints appeared to have been of a bare foot showing through a blood soaked sock, some of them appeared to be that of a shoed foot, a shoe that had a distinct pattern on the sole, and some of them appeared to be that of a foot wearing some sort of covering, as of yet unidentified, that left a distinct patterned impression in the blood.

On the bathtub, police discovered several bloody transfer impressions with a very distinct pattern. It appeared these bloody transfer impressions in blood without any ridge detail, leading police to conclude that [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s killer had been wearing gloves. No murder weapons were located at the death scene. It appeared that at least some preliminary efforts at cleaning had been attempted.

Police entered the home thru the unlocked front door. Inside the home, police discovered [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been murdered in a particularly brutal fashion. Based on the blood splatter evidence, it was apparent that [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had initially been attacked while she was in her bed. The attack then moved to the floor between the bed and the wall. This area had extensive blood pooling, smearing and spattering. The blood splatter was consistent with a medium velocity bloodletting event i.e a beating with either fists or some type of blunt object.

[[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was apparently rendered defenceless at this location, as bloody drag marks led from this location down the hall into a bathroom. During this portion of the struggle, [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s panties and Kotex (menstrual pad) were either removed by her assailant or came off during the fight.

[[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was menstruating at the time of her murder, so it is unlikely she would have been sleeping without her panties and feminine hygiene product.

Inside the bathroom, police discovered [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body inside the bathtub. The bathtub was full of water. [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was clothed only in a grey t-shirt, and was face down in the water. The bathwater was tepid, and [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body temperature was consistent with her having been in the tub for several days.

Police later determined it would take approximately 17 minutes to fill the tub to the point they found it in. Due to the injuries that [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had sustained to her face, police were initially unable to positively identify her.

Police located no signs of forced entry. There was no evidence that the home had been ransacked or searched. Various items (laptops, smart phones, TV's) that would commonly be stolen in a burglary were left untouched. It appeared that [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been targeted.

Police began a search of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[04 Car|car]] at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had a [[02 Garmin GPS|Garmin]] portable [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]].

Police also found an unopened box of Playtex brand latex gloves and a new 5 gallon gas container.

Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] were consistent with what was found at the death scene.

According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.".

Similarly, police purchased a [[03 Mallet|mallet]] identical to the [[03 Mallet|mallet]] purchased by [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]] and requested a [[03 Forensic Evidence|forensic]] scientist compare the [[03 Mallet|mallet]] to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [[03 Mallet|mallet]].

[[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s financial records show that on [[2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012|2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle.
