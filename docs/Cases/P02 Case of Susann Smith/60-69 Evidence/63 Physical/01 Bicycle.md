[Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s financial records show that on [2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012](2012-11-24%20Saturday%20November%2024th%202012.md), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle.

This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), where he told them his last bike ([bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md)) was stolen from his Ravenna [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) sometime in [2012-10 October 2012](Cases/P02%20Case%20of%20Susann%20Smith/10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2012-10%20October%202012.md).

The [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased in [2012-11 November 2012](2012-11%20November%202012.md), and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [Canyon Park QFC](03%20Canyon%20Park%20QFC.md) by an employee there. This is a store that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013](2013-02-10%20Sunday%20February%2010th%202013.md) and [2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013](2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md).

This witness estimates the date he first saw the [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) as around [2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013](2013-02-21%20Thursday%20February%2021st%202013.md). This same witness later saw the same [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013](2013-02-21%20Thursday%20February%2021st%202013.md), but before [2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013](2013-02-28%20Thursday%20February%2028th%202013.md).

The witness called police who came and collected the [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md). A check of the [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md)'s serial number confirmed it was the same [bicycle](01%20Bicycle.md) as the one purchased by [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) in [2012-11 November 2012](2012-11%20November%202012.md).
