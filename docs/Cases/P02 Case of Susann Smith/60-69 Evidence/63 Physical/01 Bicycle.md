[[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s financial records show that on [[2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012|2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle.

This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [[2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], where he told them his last bike ([[01 Bicycle|bicycle]]) was stolen from his Ravenna [[05 Apartment|apartment]] sometime in [[Cases/P02 Case of Susann Smith/10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10 October 2012|Cases/P02 Case of Susann Smith/10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10 October 2012]].

The [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased in [[2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]], and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [[03 Canyon Park QFC|Canyon Park QFC]] by an employee there. This is a store that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [[2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013|2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013]] and [[2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]].

This witness estimates the date he first saw the [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] as around [[2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013|2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013]]. This same witness later saw the same [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [[2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013|2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013]], but before [[2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013|2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013]].

The witness called police who came and collected the [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]]. A check of the [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]]'s serial number confirmed it was the same [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] as the one purchased by [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] in [[2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]].
