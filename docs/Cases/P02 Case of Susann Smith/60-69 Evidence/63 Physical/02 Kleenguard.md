Police began a search of [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [car](04%20Car.md) at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had a [Garmin](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) portable [GPS](02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md).

Police started the search of [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) shortly after completing the search of the [car](04%20Car.md). During the course of this search, [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) indicated he had purchased the [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [Coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md) at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett. [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) indicated he had lunch at Taco Bell.

On [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](03%20Mallet.md), two sets of [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md) was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md) were consistent with what was found at the death scene.

According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.".

[Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) admitted purchasing two [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md) at Home Depot at this time.

At the time [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s purpose was in going to the area of [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home on [2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013](2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md), but it is known that at that time he had in his [car](04%20Car.md) two packages of [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md), a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [croc style shoes](06%20Croc-style%20Shoes.md).
