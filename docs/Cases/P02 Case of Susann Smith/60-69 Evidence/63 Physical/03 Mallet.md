# 03 Mallet

Police also contacted an ex-girlfriend of [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md), [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md). [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) had been dating [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) from September 2012 ([2012-09 September 2012](2012-09%20September%202012.md)) until late November 2012 ([2012-11 November 2012](2012-11%20November%202012.md). According to [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) often "ranted and ranted" about [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md), the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move the two [children](07%20Children.md) to Germany. During one angry rant in October 2012 ([2012-10 October 2012](Cases/P02%20Case%20of%20Susann%20Smith/10-19%20Case%20Dates/11%20Background%20Dates/2012-10%20October%202012.md)), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) queried something to the effect: "how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing". Several days following this in another angry phone call [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) stated that he "just wanted her to be done with". [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) also related that in one conversation she had with [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md), she mentioned that a friend of hers from the military told her how one could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising. [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) replied that "you could do that with a rubber [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) too". [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) helped [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) move from an [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) in Seattle to an [apartment](05%20Apartment.md) in [Bothell](04%20Bothell.md) in [2012-11 November 2012](2012-11%20November%202012.md). During this move, [Rachel Amrine](04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) saw and packed a rubber headed [mallet](03%20Mallet.md).

On [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md), [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](03%20Mallet.md), two sets of [Kleenguard](02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](02%20Kleenguard.md), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Similarly, police purchased a [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) identical to the [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) purchased by [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) on [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md) and requested a [forensic](03%20Forensic%20Evidence.md) scientist compare the [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md). The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md) exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [mallet](03%20Mallet.md).

The significance of [Dr Adams](04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md)' findings was, among other things, that two different weapons were used to kill [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md). ^hw10w  
[Dr Adams](04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) was shown a type of [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) that the police were able to document [Alan Smith](01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchasing on [2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012](2012-10-27%20Sunday%20October%2027th%202012.md). ^rk526  
[Dr Adams](04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) opined that this type of weapon would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md).

[Kathy Geil](05%20Kathy%20Geil.md), forensic scientist at Washington State Police, also examined photographs of the injuries and the [mallet](03%20Mallet.md), and indicated the [mallet](03%20Mallet.md) was "consistent" with the wound patterns documented on [autopsy](01%20Autopsy.md) photos. ^ca0gh  
It is also apparent from looking at the location of the various wounds on [Susann Smith](01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body that the sole intent of her assailant was to kill her.
