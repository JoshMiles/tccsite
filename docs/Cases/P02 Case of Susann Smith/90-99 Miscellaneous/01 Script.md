## Introduction

Tuesday the 12th of February, 2013.[^1]

[[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]], Washington State, the United States.

A concerned co-worker contacted the local police after a 37 year old woman failed to show up for work for two days in a row.[^2]



## Victim Background

## Lead up to Crime

In [[../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2009|2009]], Susann and [[../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] bought and moved into a house together in the 200 Block of 240th Street SW, [[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]].[^3] 

Their life together seemed to have been going well, with Alan finding work at the local [[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant as they raised their two [[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]].

Though, the happy life that their friends and family saw from the outside had been riddled with issues consuming their relationship behind closed doors.

So much so, that on Friday the 18th of November 2011, the couple filed for divorce.[^4] 

And on that same day, Alan moved out of [[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/02 The Smith House|The Smith House]] and into an [[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] in [[../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]].[^5] 

The main cause of concern for the divorce had been the custody of their two [[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]], and on Friday the 3rd of August 2012, a hearing took place regarding a temporary parenting plan that was submitted by Susann[^7]  - which is essentially an agreement that contains information about where your child will live and how you and the other parents will care for your child/[[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] during the divorce proceedings, the temporary plan lasting until the divorce is finalized and the permanent parenting plan is in place.[^6]

The [[../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|Commissioner]] of this hearing largely adopted the plan, which had been in Susann’s favour.[^8] 

After the hearing, Susann and Alan had what was described as a disagreement about who would be spending time with their [[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] during the summer, with Alan growing increasingly angry.[^9] [^10] 

Susann’s divorce attorney, a man called [[../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]], took note of this disagreement especially when Alan became fixed on Susann with what he described as an “*incredibly angry*” stare that lasted about five or so seconds.[^11] 

This stare had been something the like [[../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] had never seen in his some 15 years of practise, and it had been concerning enough to [[../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] that he actually asked Susann about it afterwards, and mentioned it to his staff.[^12] 

In September of 2012, Alan actually began dating a different woman by the name of [[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]].[^13] 

Alan hadn’t been shy of making his thoughts and opinions known about the divorce and about Susann to his new girlfriend Rachel, with Alan asking during one angry rant to Rachel: “*how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing*”.[^14] 

Several days after that angry rant, in an angry phone call, Alan told Rachel that he “*just wanted her to be done with*” - presumably referring to the mother of his [[../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]], Susann.[^15] 

In another discussion between Alan and Rachel, Rachel mentioned that one of her friends who had been in the military had once told her how you could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising[^16] , to which Alan replied "*you could do that with a rubber mallet too*".[^17] 

Alan would often "rant and rant" about Susann to Rachel, getting heated about the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move their two children to Germany.[^18] 

On one notable occasion, Alan told Rachel that he would like to just get rid of Susann Smith and asked her if she knew of any way of making that happen without anyone knowing and Rachel responded, in what she would later claim to have been a joking manner, that they could use potassium chloride or a rubber mallet to kill someone.[^19] 

When Alan once again mentioned his desire for Susann to disappear, Rachel began to grow very concerned that this wasn't a dark joke anymore and she began to wonder whether or not Alan was serious about it.[^20] 

On Sunday the 27th of October, 2012, financial records showed that Alan had visited a Home Depot store and purchased a rubber mallet, two packs of Kleenguard Chemical Splash Resistant Coveralls, and disposable shoe covers[^21]  - the nature of this purchase especially following his conversations with Rachel became a major cause of concern for her.
