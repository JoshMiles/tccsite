### Case Structure

Briefly, the notation for folders follows `PRO.AC.ID` (where `PRO` is the project, `AC` is the area and category and `ID` is the unique identifier for the file). Where `ID` is referenced in notation, it simply means all files under that folder.

You can access directly any file by going to `truecrimecases.com/PRO-AC-ID` where you replace the decimal separator with a dash.
