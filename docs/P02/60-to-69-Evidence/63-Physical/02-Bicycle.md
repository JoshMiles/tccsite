This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md), where he told them his last bike ([bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md)) was stolen from his Ravenna [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md) sometime in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/08-2012-10-October-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/08-2012-10-October-2012.md).

The [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md) that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) purchased in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md), and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [Canyon Park QFC](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Canyon-Park-QFC.md) by an employee there. This is a store that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md) and [02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md).

This witness estimates the date he first saw the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md) as around [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013.md). This same witness later saw the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md) unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013.md), but before [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/09-2013-02-28-Thursday-February-28th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/09-2013-02-28-Thursday-February-28th-2013.md).

The witness called police who came and collected the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md). A check of the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md)'s serial number confirmed it was the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md) as the one purchased by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md).
