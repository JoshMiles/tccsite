# The Script
# Introduction

Tuesday the 12th of February, 2013.[^1]

[Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#), Washington State, the United States.

A concerned co-worker contacted the local police after a 37 year old woman failed to show up for work for two days in a row.[^2]

# Victim Background

# Lead up to Crime

In [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/02-2009](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/02-2009.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) bought and moved into a house together in the 200 Block of 240th Street SW, [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#).[^3] 

Their life together seemed to have been going well, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) finding work at the local [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#) plant as they raised their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#).

Though, the happy life that their friends and family saw from the outside had been riddled with issues consuming their relationship behind closed doors.

So much so, that on Friday the 18th of November 2011, the couple filed for divorce.[^4] 

And on that same day, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#) moved out of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#) and into an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#).[^5] 

The main cause of concern for the divorce had been the custody of their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and on Friday the 3rd of August 2012, a hearing took place regarding a temporary parenting plan that was submitted by [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)[^6] - which is essentially an agreement that contains information about where your child will live and how you and the other parents will care for your child/[children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#) during the divorce proceedings, the temporary plan lasting until the divorce is finalized and the permanent parenting plan is in place.[^7]

The [Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#) of this hearing largely adopted the plan, which had been in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s favour.[^8] 

After the hearing, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had what was described as a disagreement about who would be spending time with their [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#) during the summer, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) growing increasingly angry.[^9] [^10] 

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s divorce attorney, a man called [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#), took note of this disagreement especially when [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) became fixed on [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) with what he described as an "*incredibly angry*" stare that lasted about five or so seconds.[^11] 

This stare had been something the like [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#) had never seen in his some 15 years of practise, and it had been concerning enough to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#) that he actually asked [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) about it afterwards, and mentioned it to his staff.[^12] 

In September of 2012, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) actually began dating a different woman by the name of [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#).[^13] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) hadn't been shy of making his thoughts and opinions known about the divorce and about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to his new girlfriend Rachel, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) asking during one angry rant to Rachel: "*how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing*".[^14] 

Several days after that angry rant, in an angry phone call, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) told Rachel that he "*just wanted her to be done with*" - presumably referring to the mother of his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^15] 

In another discussion between [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and Rachel, Rachel mentioned that one of her friends who had been in the military had once told her how you could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising[^16] , to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) replied "*you could do that with a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#) too*".[^17] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would often "rant and rant" about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to Rachel, getting heated about the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to Germany.[^18] 

On one notable occasion, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) told Rachel that he would like to just get rid of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and asked her if she knew of any way of making that happen without anyone knowing and Rachel responded, in what she would later claim to have been a joking manner, that they could use potassium chloride or a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#) to kill someone.[^19] 

When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) once again mentioned his desire for [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to disappear, Rachel began to grow very concerned that this wasn't a dark joke anymore and she began to wonder whether or not [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was serious about it.[^20] 

On Sunday the 27th of October, 2012, financial records showed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had visited a Home Depot store and purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#.md#), two packs of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#), and disposable shoe covers[^21] - the nature of this purchase especially following his conversations with Rachel became a major cause of concern for her.

At some point in November of 2012, Rachel helped [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) move from an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) that he was living in Seattle to an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#) - the same place where Susan lived.[^22] 

We know that on Saturday the 24th of November 2012, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#) for $616 from Gregg's Green Lake in Seattle.[^23] 

And at some point before the end of that November month, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and Rachel separated.[^24] 

On Thursday the 13th of December, 2012, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed paperwork relating to his divorce that claimed he now believed [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been sexually assaulting their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^25] 

These filings had been as part of a motion to reconsider a failure by [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#) to order a GAL, or Guardian AD Litem[^26] [^27], appointed to the case.[^28] 

> [!note]  
> According to Snohomish County's website, a Guardian ad Litem, or GAL, when talking about family law is a person or persons that are appointed to represent the best interests of a child/[children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), an alleged incapacitated person, or a person in a minor settlement case, for specific purposes and specific periods of time, or in conflict cases when the Court needs information from a neutral source.  
> Under the direction of the Court, the GAL performs an investigation and prepares a report. GALs do not act as lawyers, therapists, or parties in the case, and therefor do not provide legal advise, counselling, or diagnosis.

> [!note]  
> In some divorce and child custody cases in Washington State, a specially-trained guardian ad litem (GAL) is assigned to the case by the court to investigate and determine what the best interests of the child or [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#) is.

As soon as [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney, [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#), heard of the nature of this filing - he was absolutely outraged.[^29] 

And due to the holiday season quickly approaching, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would have to live with these allegations until after the New Year came around before seeing if the courts would believe her or her soon to be ex-husband which likely would've caused her a lot of stress. (**note: this is the author's inference**)

The courts finally addressed the motion on Thursday the 10th of January 2013, with [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#.md#) denying the motion[^30] and awarding [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) $500 in attorney fees for having to respond to the motion.[^31] 

Following this hearing for the motion, Susan actually sent an email to her attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#) in which she indicated that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been making up stories about her in an effort to win in court.[^32] 

The following day, on Friday the 11th of January 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed a Motion of Revision of [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s Ruling on the GAL - which essentially meant he appealed the ruling against his allegations.[^33] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also proceeded to file papers that indicated that he was scared that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) might move the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#) to her native country of Germany, which would prevent him from seeing his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^34] 

On Friday the 25th of January, 2013, a hearing was held in regards to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s motion of revision in front of a judge called [Judge Fair](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/04-Judge-Fair.md#), and [Judge Fair](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/04-Judge-Fair.md#) ultimately found there to have been no merit to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s accusations, and once again ruled in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s favour.[^35] 

According to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney, [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), after this hearing took place, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been waiting in the hall outside the courtroom when she was approached by [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) who called her a "*monster*".[^36] 

A business trip had been scheduled by [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to travel to Ireland with two of his co-workers, [Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#) and [Colin Warner](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Colin-Warner.md#), departing on Monday the 4th of February 2013.[^37] 

On this trip, according to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s co-worker Matthew, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) talked almost exclusively about his divorce.[^38] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) ranted and raved that the court hearings were not going in his favour and detailed his anger about it, blaming the court system as one that had been rigged to favour women and that it was all a conspiracy to take all of his money from him[^39] - [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) told Matthew that the courts were a "*fixed system*".[^40] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s co-workers would later estimate that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would change the topic of conversation while on this trip to Ireland to be about his family problems at least 60-70% of the time.[^41] 

His other co-worker, Colin, would later describe a conversation that he had with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on the Ireland trip in which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) commented "*I want her to know the pain I feel*" - talking about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^42] 

Colin would also later explain how [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) told him that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been mentally abusive towards him, and apparently used to treat their dog poorly.[^43] 

[Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#.md#) also later revealed that he was told by [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) several times that his wife, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), was "*pure evil*" and called her a "*psychopath*".[^44] 

This kind of conversation about [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s divorce hadn't been unusual at all for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), as according to Matthew, in the two or three years that he had known [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the majority of their conversations had centred around [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s divorce and his wife.[^45] 

The business trip to Ireland wrapped up on Wednesday the 6th of February 2013, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) returning home to Washington on Saturday the 9th - arriving at the airport at midday.[^46] 

After departing the airport, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) drove over to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#) which was where [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) lived to pick up the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as it had been his turn to have custody, arriving at the house at about 2pm.

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had actually been hosting a Fasching party that afternoon, which is a German carnival celebration described as being the German version of Mardi Gras, and a number of [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) from the local neighbourhood had been there at the Smith house as part of this party.[^47] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) stuck around at this party, seemingly to allow his two [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to enjoy the festivities, and actually went inside the Smith house.[^48] 

He went into the kitchen, two of the bedrooms, the hallway, the bathroom and the living room.[^49] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also took his son into the restroom while he was at the house[^50] , before leaving with both [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at about 2:30pm.[^51] 

This party would be, according to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the last time that he saw [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) alive.[^52] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) claimed that he spent the following day, Sunday the 10th of February 2013, with his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#), watching movies at his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#) with his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that evening and that they had all slept there.  
[^53] 

Financial records did indicate that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had visited [Canyon Park QFC](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Canyon-Park-QFC.md#)[^54] , which is a supermarket[^55] , that day.

While it is not corroborated by official sources, it seems reasonable to infer that he likely needed to grab some groceries and supplies for himself and his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) after spending the week in Ireland on business (**note: this is the author's inference**).

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), that day, used her time away from her [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to catch up with some of her friends.[^56] 

That Sunday, she spoke with a friend from Germany over the phone before heading to choir practice.[^57] 

After which [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) met up with her friend Ani to go to see Music Man in Seattle.[^58] 

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and Ani had met up at the theatre, the 5th Avenue Theater, and settled into their seats ready for the show to start at 7pm.[^59] [^60] 

After the show, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) dropped Ani back off at her home and then returned to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#) sometime before 10:30pm.[^61] 

It had been at around this tame time that one of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s neighbours, a [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#), returned back home with his daughter and saw [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) standing outside the front of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^62] 

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) saw [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#.md#) and headed over to talk to him - the conversation had been quick, after which Susan returned back to her home. [^63] 

Though, Susan didn't go straight to bed when she got back home.[^64] 

Instead, she turned on her computer and access the internet[^65] , logging in to her online banking account[^66] before going to Netflix[^67] to watch a show or movie (**note: this is the author's inference**).

By 11:35pm, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had still been watching Netflix.[^68] 

That had been the last known movement of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).

# Crime

On Monday the 11th of February 2013, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) failed to show up for work, and failed to answer phone calls from work who were trying to find out if she had been running late or if she had any other reason for not showing up.[^69] 

[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) dropped off the two [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at the day care that morning[^70] , and picked them up after he had finished his shift at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#) plant.[^71] 

According to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#), he and the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spent that night at [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^72] 

The following day, on Tuesday the 12th of February 2013, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) failed to show up to work for the second day in a row.[^73] 

Efforts were made by her co-workers and employer to get a hold of Susan, but to no avail.[^74] 

This failure to show up for work and failure to answer phone calls was completely out of character and described as being highly unusual for [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^75] 

And so, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s co-workers contacted the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Police Department and informed them that she had not shown up for work[^76] and that they were concerned for her wellbeing. (**note: this is the author's inference**)

The police subsequently carried out a welfare check on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^77] 

Officers arrived at [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home for the welfare check at approximately 11:30am[^78] - though it must be noted that earlier reports detail them arriving an hour earlier at about 10:30am[^79] , but we shall be using the timings of the later reports - and when they arrived, they knocked on the door of the Smith house but received no response from inside.[^80] 

The officers then decided to walk around the home and peer in through the windows[^81] to see whether they could see any indication that anyone had been home. (**note: this is the author's inference**)

And it was while they were looking in through the window of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bedroom that they saw significant amounts of blood on the floor and on the wall.[^82] 

The officers then returned to the front of the house and tried the front door, which had been unlocked, and entered the Smith house.[^83] 

Inside the family home, they discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), a 37 year old mother of two, had been murdered in what they described to have been a particularly brutal fashion[^84] in the bathtub of her home.[^85] 

The Washington State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team, or CRST, was contacted to assist in processing the crime scene[^86] who wouldn't arrived until later that evening[^87] . 

Based on the blood splatter evidence, it had become apparent that Susan had initially been attacked while she had been in her bed.[^88] 

The attack then moved to the floor between the bed and the wall[^89] , which had extensive blood pooling, smearing and splattering.[^90] 

It was apparent that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been rendered defenceless while on the floor, with bloody drag marks leading from the floor down the hall and into the bathroom.[^91] 

Inside the bathroom, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body lay face down[^92] in the bathtub which had been full of water.[^93] 

[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) had been clothed only in a grey t-shirt[^94] , and her body temperature had been consistent with her having been in the tub for multiple days.[^95] 

Horrifically, due to the injuries that Susan had sustained to her face, the police had been initially unable to positively identify her.[^96] 

During the processing of the home, the police discovered a number of footprints left in blood in various locations in the house.[^97] 

Some of these bloody footprints appeared to have been of a bare foot showing through a blood soaked sock, some of them appeared to have been that of a shoed foot - a shoe which had a distinct pattern on the sole -, and some of them appeared to have been that of a foot wearing some sort of covering that left a distinct patterned impression in the blood.[^98] 

On the bathtub itself, the police discovered several bloody transfer impressions with a very distinct pattern.[^99] 

It appeared that these bloody transfer impressions did not have any ridge detail, which indicated that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)'s killer had been wearing gloves at the time.[^100] 

It also appeared that at least some preliminary efforts at cleaning up the crime scene had been attempted.[^101] 

Notably, the police found no signs of forced entry[^102] , and no murder weapons at the crime scene.[^103] 

There had been no evidence that the Smith home had been ransacked or searched[^104] , with various items such as laptops, smart phones and TV's that would commonly be stolen in a burglary being left untouched. [^105]  

This led the investigators to concluded that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been targeted.[^106] 

# Investigation

A full scale homicide investigation was launched, with [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#) quickly arriving on the scene. (**note: this is the author's inference**)

The detectives quickly learnt from speaking with the neighbours of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#) that she had an estranged husband called [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) worked at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#) plant in Everett.[^107] 

At approximately 2pm, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#), [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) and uniformed Office Caban left [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) for the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Plant.[^108] 

En route, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#) contact [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Security Office Brian Ferguson and requested a meeting with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^109] 

He detailed the purpose of the visit to both inform [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that his wife appeared to have been murdered, that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were safe, and to see if [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) appeared to have any injuries that may have been associated with the murder, and to find out [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s whereabouts at relevant times to the crime.[^110] 

The two detectives and the uniformed officer arrived at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) plant at about 2:45pm.[^111] [^112] 

Upon their arrival, they were escorted into one of [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s conference rooms by security[^113] and, shortly thereafter, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was also escorted into the conference room.[^114] 

[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#) introduced himself and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#.md#) to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and told him that they would like to talk with him.[^115] 

It's important to note that the uniformed officer was seated in the far corner of the conference room and had no interaction with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)[^116] directly, while [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) sat at the head of the conference table[^117] with the two detectives who had been dressed in plain clothes.[^118] 

The detectives informed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that they were investigating a serious crime, but importantly that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were safe[^119] , before telling [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that they had located a dead body at [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^120] 

[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then proceeded to give the police his first account of his activities over the past several days, which included when he claimed to have last seen [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and the state of the pending divorce.[^121] 

After [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) disclosed this account, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) attempted to press [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) further and mentioned that divorce and child custody hearings could be very emotional, asking [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) whether he had any reason to harm [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^122] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) did not answer the detective.[^123] 

So, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) the question again.[^124] 

To which, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said: "*I think I may need to talk to an attorney.*"[^125] 

It was at that point that [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) informed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that he was not under arrest, and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated that he understood what the detective was saying.[^126] 

Now, it's important to note that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) did not ask these detectives as to whose body had been found[^127] , and according to the two detectives, it seemed as if [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s reaction had been rehearsed.[^128] 

It was at this point that the detectives took note of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s obviously swollen left hand and a cut that he had sustained to his left thumb.[^129] 

The detectives asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) whether they could take photographs of his hands, to which he agreed.[^130] 

[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then excused himself and stepped away from the conference room to call the assigned prosecutor, and they decided that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was not going to be detained at that time and that he was free to go.[^131] 

The interview in the conference room came to an end at approximately 4:30pm[^132] , and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) agreed to let the detectives drive him back to his building where his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#) had been parked.[^133] 

[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) sat in the back of the police vehicle as they drove to his building[^134] , with no further questioning taking place.[^135] 

When they arrived at his building, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) went inside and retrieved his laptop.[^136] 

And as he was doing so, the detectives placed another call to the assigned prosecutor and it was subsequently determined that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would be placed with child protective services, or [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#), until [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been cleared in the homicide investigation. [^137] 

When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) left his office building, the detectives informed him that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were going into [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#) until further notice, and that the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#) paperwork could be retrieved at [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Police Department.[^138] 

The detectives handed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) directions to the police department so he could pick up the paperwork.[^139]

And this ended the first initial police contact with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^140] 

At approximately 5:00pm, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) contacted the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Police Department to let them know that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would be enroute to them to get the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#) paperwork.[^141] 

Shortly before [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) arrived at the police department, he actually left a message on [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s voicemail in which he asked whether the police wanted to look around his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) or take a [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#) sample. [^142] [^143] 

>[!note] Editor's Note
>The following quote displayed on screen as the previous paragraph is spoken:
>
>"*Hello [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), this is [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), uh, who you just interviewed today. Uhm, I wo…so I'm at the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Police Station. I wonder if you would like for me to let you into my [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to have a look around or anything else you might need from..a..[DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#.md#) sample, I don't know if you need a blood sample or something like that. You're welcome to those. So, if you get a chance, call me back as soon as you can. Thanks. Bye.*"

The detective wouldn't hear this message until two days later, on the 14th of February, when he checked his voicemail but as you'll soon find out, it didn't matter all too much.[^144] 

At 6:00pm, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) arrived at the police department and entered the front lobby.[^145] 

A member of staff and [Detective Thompson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/07-Detective-Thompson.md#) met with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and together they went over the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#) paperwork.[^146] 

It was during this conversation that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) told them that his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#) had been parked outside and that the police could search it and his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) if they wanted to.[^147] 

[Detective Thompson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/07-Detective-Thompson.md#.md#) explained that there were forms [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would have to signed if that was what he wanted, and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated that he'd be fine with that.[^148] 

Detective Stone was then contacted at 6:35pm and informed of Alan's consent for a search[^149] , with Detective Stone and Detective Chissus arriving back at the Bothell Police Department at 6:55pm to meet with Alan to go through the paperwork.[^150] 

Alan wrote this brief statement in which he indicated that he was initiating contact with detectives and that he did not need the presence of his lawyer while the police inspected his car and apartment. (on screen: [../../20-to-29-Case-Files/22-PDFs/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=12](../../../assets/attachments/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf))[^151] 

Detective Stone then went over the Ferrier consent form with Alan, which he signed. (on screen: [../../20-to-29-Case-Files/22-PDFs/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=14](../../../assets/attachments/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf))[^152] 

The search of Alan Smith's car began at approximately 7:00pm.[^153] 

During the search, the police located a plastic bag from Home Depot that contained two further unopened bags of Kleenguard Chemical Splash Resistant Coveralls.[^155] [^156] 

They also located a roll of tape[^157] , an unopened box of Playtex brand latex gloves, a new 5 gallon gas container[^158]  and a portable Garmin GPS on the front dash.[^159] 

A brief conversation ensued in which Alan Smith stated that he had been planning on painting an "*accent*" wall in his apartment to justify the coveralls and the roll of tape.[^154] [^160] 

At the conclusion of the search of his car, Alan was asked by the detectives if he would still consent to a search of his apartment[^161] , which he agreed to.[^162] 

Alan Smith then drove himself to his apartment, followed closely by Detective Stone and Detective Chissus[^163]  - with the trio arriving there at approximately 7:30pm.[^164] 

A number of detectives also arrived at Alan's apartment shortly thereafter to assist in the search.[^165] 

Alan Smith read and signed a consent to search form at 7:26pm.[^166] (on screen: [../../20-to-29-Case-Files/22-PDFs/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=16](../../../assets/attachments/04 13-1-01546-8 37 (3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf))

During the course of the search of his apartment, Alan Smith apparently spoke with two of the detectives and discussed a number of topics but its unclear what exactly they spoke about.[^167] 

At about 8:40pm, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) mentioned that he was willing to volunteer a buccal swab for DNA purposes[^169] , which he did without being prompted by the police.[^170] 

The investigators accepted his offer and subsequently obtained two separate DNA samples of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s saliva.[^171] 

[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then sat down with [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in his [Apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and gave a taped statement at 8:42pm.[^172]
