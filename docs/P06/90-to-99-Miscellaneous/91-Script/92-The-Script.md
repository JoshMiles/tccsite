# The Script  
  
So a while back I got a few DMs on Instagram from some of you lovely people letting me know about some case updates in the case of Sanda Dia.  
  
I covered Sanda Dia's case about two years ago and it has been one that has stuck with me ever since.  
  
It's truly a case rooted in evil.  
  
I'm going to provide a quick summary of the case in just a moment, but if you wanted to get a deep dive into complexities of the case, you can find my full video on this channel linked at the top and in the description.  
  
If you're the kinda person that prefers the podcast format, you can also find all of my videos and any future futures in podcast form on your favourite streaming platform by searching True Crime with Joshua Miles - I'll leave a direct link to the podcast episode and the youtube video in the pinned comment.  
  
Sanda Dia had been 20 years old at the time of his death, and had been a civil engineering student at KU Leuven - which is one of Belgium's most prestigious universities.  
  
His father had worked in a factory, and Sanda had not been from a wealthy or influential as many of the other students at the university had been.  
  
Sanda decided to join a fraternity at the university as a way to improve his life prospects, and to network for his future career post graduation.  
  
Though, after he joined the fraternity, he was subjected to a hazing ceremony that involved excessive drinking, physical and mental abuse.  
  
The hazing included tasks consisting of drinking large amounts of alcohol, and being made to consume substances such as fish oil.  
  
This hazing event took place over multiple days, and culminated in a task in which the initiates were made to stand in freezing water-filled pits.  
  
Sanda, by this point, had already been severely intoxicated and was actually mostly unresponsive but he was still subjected to further tasks such as swallowing a live goldfish and drinking more fish oil.  
  
Tragically, as his condition worsened, and after waiting far too long to seek medical attention, he was finally taken to the hospital where he would sadly pass away shortly after admission.  
  
In the aftermath of Sanda's death, the fraternity members proceeded to clean up all evidence pertaining to the hazing, and they were advised by their lawyers to not apologise to Sanda's family - the fraternity members, as I mentioned earlier, all came from wealthy or influential families which plays a massive part in this case.  
  
The university initially only required the fraternity members to complete just 30 hours of community service and to write a paper as punishment for what they did to Sanda Dia.  
  
The fraternity itself disbanded, and no public apologies were made.  
  
The case itself took two years to go to court due to conflicts of interest, with many of the fraternity members actually having parents who were judges or lawyers.  
  
Charges were brought against the 18 fraternity members that included degrading treatment, administration of harmful substances, and manslaughter which carried a prison sentence of 2 to 10 years.  
  
And the trial itself had been delayed multiple times at the point that I covered Sanda's case.   
  
Students at KU Lueven held sit-ins demanding justice for Sanda, and at the end of my original video on the case, I asked you all to signed a petition to facilitate the arrest of all 18 of the fraternity members which you all came out in force to help out with - I can't thank you enough.  
  
This was just a very very quick summary of the case itself, which has far more complexities and societal implications involving issues of class and power that we can't simplify easily for this case update - so I strongly recommend you check out my deep dive if you're not familiar with the case to fully grasp the context behind it.  
  
And that brings us to the updates in this case.  
  
We're going to be going through the day-by-day events of the trial to see how the courts came to the judgement that it did, and as there are 18 people accused during this trial it can be a bit confusing to follow so stick with me through this.  
  
The case appeared in front of the Court of Appeal on the 13th of March, 2023, after being delayed from the year before due to the judge stating that she could not judge over the entire case - a decision that was appealed against, hence it ending up in the Court of Appeals.  
  
The judge in that first trial also stated that she believed that the charges against the 18 fraternity members should be reformulated to "inflicting assault and battery" which is a charge that carries a lower maximum penalty.  
  
When the case was presented in the Court of Appeals, the 18 members' charges had been   
  
>[!quote]   
>"Administering harmful substances resulting in death, with the aim of harming but not killing"  
  
This was all connected explicitly to the large amounts of fish sauce that Sanda had to drink, which ultimately proved fatal.  
  
>[!quote]   
>"The defendants obviously did not assume that administering that substance would be fatal. If that had been the case, the qualification would have been different"  
  
The public prosecutor argued on the first day of the trial that the accused were responsible for Sanda Dia's death, and should be held accountable, proposing prison sentences that ranged from 18 to 50 months.  
  
The prosecutor also suggested that fines ranging from 500 to 1000 euros and a 5 year ban from civil rights be instated for the accused.  
  
As part of the trial, a number of civil parties were included in the legal proceedings.  
  
Gaia, which is an animal rights organisation, became a civil party due to past incidents involving the fraternity and animal abuse, and they asked the court for a symbolic moral compensation of 1 euro.  
  
The University of Antwerp also became a civil party, as two of the fraternity members had been students there, and they also asked for the same 1 euro symbolic moral compensation.  
  
Also on this first day of trial, one of the other initiates who had undergone the hazing ritual with Sanda Dia spoke out, expressing his anger, confusion and stating that none of the 18 accused fraternity members had intended for this to happen.  
  
The lawyer for the two other initiates who survived the hazing argued to the court that his clients had also been victims, and that they had still been undergoing psychological treatment at the time of the trial, and interestingly this lawyer stated that the colour of Sanda Dia's skin had played no role in the events that took place.  
  
On the second day of the trial, two of the fraternity members plead partially guilty for the death of Sanda Dia, and they both expressed their personal regret for the events that occurred to the family and friends of Sanda.  
  
Sanda Dia's family lawyer argued in court that society had the right to know the names of the 18 accused fraternity members, whose names have been protected by a court order in the media - something that'll we'll explore a bit further later on in this video.  
  
The lawyer of one of the accused, who we shall call Pete, by the name of Walter Damen, pleaded for an autonomous probation sentence of two years for his client, and asked for acquittal on the charges of administering harmful substances and guilty neglect.  
  
Tom De Meester, who was the lawyer for one of the accused who we'll call Dave, told the court that his client was guilty and responsible for the death of Sanda Dia, asking for a work sentence instead of a prison sentence for his client.  
  
During that day's legal proceedings, one of the accused took the stand and expressed his sincere regret to the family and friends of Sanda Dia, stating that he had been niave and angry at himself for not realising the dangers of the hazing tradition.  
  
Pete, who was represented by the lawyer Walter Damen, also expressed his regret and said that he condemns himself for having taken any part in the hazing and the fraternity in general.  
  
Interestingly, Walter Damen called upon a forensic psychiatrist to discuss the group dynamics during the student initiations and hazing rituals, and this psychiatrist mentioned the "risky shift effect", where decisions made in a group can be potentially more dangerous than those made individually - an attempt seen by some to shift the blame from any individual to the group in its entirety.  
  
The second day of the trial came to an emotional close, with the accused seemingly showing signs of regret and a willingness to take responsibility for their actions.  
  
On the third day of trial, the pledge master for the fraternity took the stand and pleaded guilty to unintentional killing and inhumane treatment, emotionally addressing Sanda Dia's family and expressing his regret for his actions.  
  
The president of the fraternity also took the stand, emotionally telling the court that Sanda Dia should still be alive and that nobody should have been in court today before expressing his willingness to talk to the family.  
  
Another one of the accused's lawyers, Eric Boone, argued in the court that day for a work sentence for his client and also sought acquittal for administering harmful substances and guilty neglect.  
  
One of the lawyers criticized the media for creating a "distorted image" of his client due to leaks, and argued that his client should not be punished for what went wrong in the student initiations.  
  
It must be noted that both of the clients of those two lawyers did take the stand and expressed their deep regret and took responsibility for their actions, directly addressing Sanda Dia's family.  
  
Several more lawyers argued that day for the acquittal of their clients on legal grounds, only acknowledging the moral responsbility.  
  
And that day concluded with the fact that the issue of who exactly administered the fatal fish sauce to Sanda Dia still had to be clarified.  
  
The fourth day of the trial was more of the same kind of thing, with some of the fraternity members apologising to Sanda's family and expressing their regret for the pain that they had caused.  
  
Notably, three lawyers argued for the innocence of their clients with one not taking a stance on his clients guilt, another stating that his client could not be held criminally responsible, and the third pleading for acquittal as his client had pushed for Sanda to be taken to the hospital.  
  
It was also argued in court that day that the initiation ritual itself should not be confused with the crime, and that being present at the initiation was not enough to establish guilty - with further criticism of the media for overstepping boundaries and demonising the accused.  
  
On the fifth day of the trial, the last of the accused and their lawyers spoke.  
  
Out of the 18 accused fraternity members, 11 of them were asking for complete acquittal, while the remaining 7 had partially admitted their guilt in the death of Sanda.  
  
The court then convened to establish their verdict in the case.  
  
And it wouldn't be until two months after the last day of the trial, on Friday the 26th of May 2023, that the verdict would be announced.  
  
The court had to establish whether the 18 accused were guilty or not of:  
  
- Administering harmful substances resulting in the death of Sanda Dia  
- Administering harmful substances resulting in incapacity for work   
- For administering unintentional assault and battery  
- For degrading treatment  
- For guilty negligence  
- And for violations of animal rights laws.  
  
The court room was filled with the media, the friends and family of Sanda Dia,  and members of the public as the court entered session.  
  
The verdict was then read, the court found that all 18 of the accused had been found guilty of administering unintentional blows and injuries that led to the death of Sanda Dia.  
  
The exact judgements were:  
  
- Culpable negligence:   
	- Not guilty  
- Administration of harmful substance resulting in death:  
	- Not guilty  
- Degrading treatment of a victim:   
	- Guilty  
- Violation of animal welfare law:  
	- Guilty  
- Involuntary manslaughter:   
	- Guilty  
  
And for those guilty charges, they were all sentenced to work penalties ranging from 200 to 300 hours, which is essentially community service.  
  
All of the 18 accused were acquitted of administering harmful substances and guilty neglect.  
  
They also had to pay a fine of between 250-400 euros each.  
  
Interestingly, only 8 of the 18 accused had been present at the day of the verdict, and as they only received community service as a punishment, it would not show up on their criminal records.  
  
As one of you expressed to me over Instagram messages, that 400 euro fine and 300 hours of community service was what Sanda's life was worth to the justice system.  
  
The family of Sanda Dia expressed their disappointment that not all of their questions had been answered, particularly who exactly had administered the fish oil that had been the fatal blow.  
  
The final update I wanted to touch on was about a Dutch YouTuber by the name of Acid who received a temporary suspension on YouTube for a video he posted in which he revealed the names, photos, and jobs of the individuals involved in this case.  
  
Allegedly, this video had led to targeted harassment of the parents of one of the guilty parties.  
  
This is one of the reasons why I have opted to not name those involved in this, despite my anger and disgust at their actions, as it seems that these 18 people have the wealth and influence to cause further damage.  
  
And that is everything I have for you in this case update.  
  
Overall, an extremely disappointing result in my own opinion especially knowing the full extent of literal torture that occurred to Sanda Dia and the inhumane treatment he received.  
  
Thank you to those of you who reached out to me with this case update, if there's any case updates you have come across feel free to send them to me on instagram, twitter, discord or wherever you can reach me.
