## MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  
  
[Heather](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md) and [Kevin Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Kevin-Harer.md) allege that their daughter, [Samantha Harer](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md), was killed by her boyfriend, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md).  
  
[Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) was a police officer for the Town of Crest Hill.  
  
He allegedly shot [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to death in her apartment in the Town of Channahon.  
  
Channahon police officers investigated the shooting and allegedly covered it up as a suicide.  
  
  
(...)  
  
The individual defendants' alleged acts.  
  
In their complaint, the Harers allege that:  
  
- Case, Bogart and [McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) intentionally failed to preserve physical evidence, including DNA, fingerprints, and Samantha's bedroom door;  
- [McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) directed an evidence technician to make a finding of suicide;  
- [McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) falsely stated to an Illinois State Police forensic expert that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had aided [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to explain the blood on [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' sweatshirt;  
- Casey, Bogart, and [McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) refused to confront [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) with evidence that contradicted his account of the shooting, including evidence that he had blood splatter on his sweatshirt;  
- Casey and [McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) did not tell the Harers that a neighbour had heard a struggle shortly before the shooting;  
- Casey and Bogart falsely stated to the Harers that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s toxicology report suggested a finding of suicide; and  
- Casey and McClellan falsely stated to the Harers that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hand was positive for gunshot residue and that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' hand was negative.
