[Samantha Harer](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md) died from a gunshot wound to the head.  
  
The coroner concluded [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) committed suicide.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents, [Kevin Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Kevin-Harer.md.md) and [Heather Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md.md), reject this finding.  
  
The Harers claim [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s boyfriend, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) - a police officer for the town of Crest hill, Illinois - murdered [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) during an argument at her home in neighbouring Channahon, Illinois.  
  
The Harers sued [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) and Crest Hill in federal court: [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) for wrongful death (among other torts) and Crest Hill for its alleged unconstitutional practice of concealing officers' misconduct, which the Harers allege emboldened [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) to kill [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
The Harers also sued the Town of Channahon and its Chief of Police Shane Casey, its Deputy Chief of Police Adam Bogart, and Detective Andrew McClellan (collectively, the "Channahon defendants"), asserting these defendants denied the Harers their constitutional right of access to court when they engaged in a cover-up to protect [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md).  
  
The Channahon defendants moved to dismiss the access claim, arguing they did not prevent the Harers from initiating a wrongful death lawsuit against [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) within the statute of limitations.  
  
The district court denied the motion, holding that the Channahon defendants still frustrated their judicial access by delaying the Harers' suit and costing them money.  
  
Additionally, the court rules that clearly established law prohibited the officers' conduct, so qualified immunity did not shield the officers from suit.  
  
We reverse the court's judgement because the Harers have access to remedies - and therefore access to court - in their pending wrongful death suit.  
  
Accordingly, the Harers' access claim is not ripe for review, and we remand with instructions to dismiss it without prejudice.  
  
## Background  
  
[Kevin Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Kevin-Harer.md.md) and [Heather Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md.md) claim that their daughter [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s boyfriend, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) - a police officer in Credt Hill, Illinois - shot [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to death.  
  
  
### A. Facts  
  
On [February 12 2018](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2018-2-12-Monday-February-12th-2018.md), [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) had a fight in [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s apartment in Channahon, Illinois.  
  
Consequently, the couple slept separately that night: [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) in her bedroom and [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) on the couch.  
  
At **8:00 AM** the next morning, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) confronted [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) about her text conversations with another officer that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) discovered on her cell phone.  
  
The confrontation escalated.  
  
A neighbour heard banging on the walls and a woman repeatedly yelling: "Let me go."  
  
At **8:19 AM**, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) called 911 and told the operator that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had shot herself.  
  
He explained that they had been arguing, she had asked him to leave, and he was in the process of leaving when he heard [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s "gun rack" followed by a single shot.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s bedroom door was locked, so he "busted into the bedroom".  
  
[Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) saw [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) unconscious with a head wound and a gun laying between her legs.  
  
The operator suggested [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) perform CPR, but [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) declined; he said [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) was not breathing and that he could see her brain matter.  
  
[Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) told the operator that he never touched [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s body. (*He later recounted that he had lifted her head after she shot herself. The police never asked [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) to reconcile these inconsistent statements.*)  
  
Thereafter, police and emergency personnel arrived.  
  
They observed a gunshot wound to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s head, among other injuries, and detected a faint pulse.  
  
Although [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) told them that he was on the other side of the locked door when he heard [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) shoot herself, there was blood splattered on the front and right sleeve of [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' sweatshirt.  
  
Likewise, [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' white socks did not have any blood on them, despite that he said he was "kneeling" next to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and "talking to her" while he was still on the phone with the operator.  
  
Paramedics took [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to the hospital, where she died.  
  
An hour after the shooting, the Channahon detective in charge of investigating [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death, [Andrew McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md), examined the scene.  
  
He did so with a forensic evidence technician from the Illinois State Police.  
  
As the technician was evaluating the blood splatter evidence, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) incorrectly told him that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had rendered aid to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
The Harers believe the detective misled the technician to minimize the significance of the blood splatter on [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' sweatshirt.  
  
They home in on how the investigators failed to ask [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) why he had blood splatter on his clothing if he was not in the room when [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) discharged the weapon.  
  
What is more, the Harers say the investigators never questioned [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) about why they found [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) naked if the couple was allegedly arguing prior to the shooting.  
  
Rather, the investigators simply accepted [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' story that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) was just "depressed", as opposed to testing [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) for alcohol and drug use and looking into his prior history of violence against women.  
  
This alleged misconduct culminated in [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) either implicitly or explicitly instructing the technician to make a preliminary finding of suicide.  
  
The technician complied and - without processing any forensic evidence or talking to [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), or any other witness - determined that the scene was consistent with a suicide.  
  
A day later, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md), joined by Channahon Chief of Police [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md), told [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents that their daughter had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  
  
Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) did not tell the Harers that a neighbour had heard a struggle shortly before the shooting or that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' sweatshirt had blood splatter on it.  
  
Instead, they told the Harers that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hand was positive for gunshot residence and that [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' was negative.  
  
That was not true.  
  
No test discovered any gunshot residue on [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hands.  
  
Conversely, test revealed gunshot residue on [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)' right hand and the front and cuffs of his sweatshirt.  
  
Eventually, a police officer in neighbouring Plainfield came forward with pertinent information about [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
[Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) did not seek to interview the Plainfield officer until three days before Channahon closed its investigation.  
  
The Plainfield officer had frequently texted with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and told the detective that there was "no way" [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) would kill herself.  
  
Following the interview, Channahon promptly closed the investigation without anyone ever addressing the matter with [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md).  
  
According to the Harers, the police refused to communicate with them, failing to provide even basic information about who was supervising the investigation.  
  
At their wits' end, the Harers retained an attorney to help them get answers to their questions about their daughter's death.  
  
## B. Procedural History  
  
With the investigation into [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death up in the air, the Harers sued [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), Crest Hill, and Channahon in federal court for conspiracy and excessive force.  
  
Counsel for the Harers withdrew in November 2018.  
  
The defendants then moved to dismiss the claims alleged against them in the Harers' complaint.  
  
The district court schedule a status hearing for December 13th 2018.  
  
The Harers, lacking legal representation, did not attend.  
  
The court rescheduled the hearing and admonished the Harers to "appear at the 1/22/2019 hearing or this case will be dismissed for want of prosecution."  
  
On December 28th, 2018, the Harers met with Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md), his deputy Adam Bogart, a coroner, a prosecutor, and counsel for Channahon.  
  
Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and Deputy Bogart informed the Harers that they had officially ruled [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death a suicide.  
  
The authorities based their decision on forensic evidence demonstrating that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted.  
  
Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and Deputy Bogart additionally told the Harers that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s toxicology report pointed to suicide.  
  
Unconvinced, the Harers asked when they could receive and inspect their daughters' belongings.  
  
The authorities told them they could retrieve [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s property upon the dismissal of their civil lawsuit.  
  
Similarly, the police department refused to provide any investigative materials to the Harers until after the dismissal of their suit.  
  
Believing that the official finding of suicide now barred their pending lawsuit from proceeding, the Harers did not show up to court for the January 22 status hearing.  
  
Hence, the court dismissed the case for want of prosecution.  
  
The Harers subsequently learned that the gunshot residue analysis implicated [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), not their daughter.  
  
They also discovered that Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and Deputy Bogart's statements regarding [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s toxicology report were false.  
  
The results, in fact, were inconsistent with suicide.  
  
Accordingly, the Harers retained new counsel who swiftly moved to vacate the judgement of dismissal.  
  
In the motion, the Harers insisted that they only stopped prosecuting their case because of the incompetence and ethical lapses of original counsel.  
  
Moreover, the Harers maintained that they left the December 2018 meeting thinking that their lawsuit could not move forward after the coroner ruled [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death a suicide.  
  
The district court granted the motion and the Harers filed their first amended complaint.  
  
A few weeks later, the Harers sought leave to file a second amended complaint, reasserting their original claims and naming Chief Chasey, Deputy Bogart, and [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) as defendants in a new access-to-court claim.  
  
The court granted leave, and the Harers filed the operative second amended complaint, asserting a Monell claim against Crest Hill, an access to court claim against Casey, Bogart, McClellan and Channahon, wrongful death-battery against [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), survival act battery against [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), and survival act - intentional infliction of emotional distress against [Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md).
