JOLIET, IL —Now that Will County State's Attorney Jim Glasgow has filed a complaint accusing the attorney of Samantha Harer's family of violating ethical codes of professional conduct for Illinois lawyers, the out-of-town civil rights crusader for Samantha Harer's family is vowing not to let Glasgow and his staff intimidate her.    
  
On Monday, attorney Jennifer Bonjean's motion was filed with the courts asking that Will County Circuit Judge John Anderson make public a July 26 letter from Glasgow that apparently accuses Bonjean of ethical violations. Glasgow and his attorneys had the courthouse seal the letter, that way the press, public and not even Bonjean could read it.  
  
Instead of sending a copy to Bonjean, Glasgow's lawyers sent it to the judge who issued a $15 million civil judgment against ex-Crest Hill police officer Phil Flores. This week, Judge Anderson scheduled a hearing on whether he should disclose the State's Attorney's letter for 9 a.m. Aug. 15 in Courtroom 905.

In recent days, Bonjean informed Joliet Patch that Glasgow and his staff went ahead and filed a complaint against her with the Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission.  
  
Back on July 20, Judge Anderson determined Flores was most likely responsible for killing Harer. The off-duty 911 dispatcher with WESCOM in Plainfield died of a gunshot to her head inside the bedroom of her Channahon apartment on Bridge Street, on Feb. 13, 2018.

"As a direct and proximate cause of Felipe's misconduct, Samantha suffered severe physical and emotional injuries, including death. In summary, the Court finds that Felipe likely caused Samantha's death ... Based on the foregoing, the Court enters judgment in favor of Heather and Kevin Harer, and against Felipe 'Phil' Flores, on all counts. The Court awards the Harers compensatory damages in the amount of $15,000,000 ($10,000,000 for Count 1; $2,500,000 for Count II; and $2,500,000 for Count III)," Anderson's ruling announced.  
  
On the contrary, Glasgow remains of the belief Harer took her own life, shooting herself in the nude, inside her bedroom, even though gunshot residue was found on the clothes and hand of Flores, and his DNA was found on her gun, too, according to courtroom testimony.

Last weekend, Joliet Patch reached out to Bonjean, seeking her reaction to the efforts by Glasgow and his staff to have her disciplined in connection with the Harer case.  
  
"This is not the first nor will it be the last time a state's attorney has made spurious and unfounded allegations against me for effectively doing my job," Bonjean told Patch. "Although it is absolutely the first time a state's attorney has been foolish enough to publish false claims about me to third parties in which they are not a party and don't enjoy absolute immunity.  
  
"As always, I remain unbothered. When state's attorneys start liking me, I'll know it's time for a change in profession," Bonjean remarked.  
  
Joliet Patch asked if she believed Glasgow and his staff are pursuing the discipline complaint against her law license in Illinois because she spoke out and directed criticism against Glasgow and his criminal prosecutors over the Harer case.

"Glasgow had his chance. I'd be defensive, too. But he should just man up and stand by his decision or agree to relook at it," declared Jennifer Bonjean, attorney for Samantha Harer's parents. File/John Ferak/Patch  
  
"It is worth emphasizing that the Will County State's Attorney's Office is not a party to this litigation, so one has to wonder why it inserted itself into it," Bonjean responded. "Clearly, the office is defensive about the criticism it has received from various places related to its charging decision ... But there is no defense to attempting to influence the court with ex parte communications and lodging harassing ARDC (Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission) complaints against attorneys in matters that do not involve them.  
  
"That office has no clue what occurred the last three years of discovery. That the office was never interested in finding out what evidence we developed that they missed just speaks to their indifference to the case," Bonjean added. "Glasgow had his chance. I'd be defensive, too. But he should just man up and stand by his decision or agree to relook at it. The rest of this side show is just plain embarrassing."  
  
On Tuesday, Joliet Patch reached out to State's Attorney's Office spokeswoman Carole Cheney seeking reaction to Bonjean's comments about Glasgow.  
  
Patch will update this story if Cheney responds with any remarks.  
  
Meanwhile, Paul Ciolino, a prominent Chicago private investigator who used to have a weekly radio show on WLS-AM 890, shared Joliet Patch's latest article about the Samantha Harer case to his Facebook page and posted several comments about the case.  
  
Ciolino has been involved with the [Harer case since 2018](https://patch.com/illinois/joliet/phil-flores-no-longer-crest-hill-police-force). He also helped the Harer family and her friends establish a [college scholarship in Samantha's memory at the University of St. Francis](https://patch.com/illinois/channahon-minooka/it-was-homicide-should-have-never-happened) in Joliet, where she graduated in 2016 and majored in criminal justice.  
  
"In the continuing saga of the failure of the Will County States Attorney’s office to take action they have now doubled down showing even more reason to be suspicious of their actions in the Samantha Harer case," Ciolino told his Facebook followers. "If the suspect was anyone else but a cop his ass would have been in jail years ago. Enough is enough, and the only question that remains is when does the Harer family get some justice?"

New liquor brings crime or violence. It’s seems like lots call from liquor store . Can you pl advise how many calls come from liquor store may be 1percent among all business.    
I do had gas stations. 50% call from gas station. And which is misunderstanding cause of credit card processing system between customers and station. There is nothing between customer to station its credit card process. And during Covid. Lots call. All over USA.    
IF THEIR IS MORE RETAIL BUSINESS IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD. ITS. REALLY GOOD. RATHER THEN EMPTY SPACE.    
Look and find how many calls from DUNKIN .  
  
Ranch liquor. Is very small and close eairly he do not had lots of variety    
Sugar creed is small too  
  
This liquor store will be in 6000 square feet. May be future puts more groceries and look like big convenience store around their area  
  
As my experience. There is very less call from liquor store then. DUNKIN. Gas station. And other retail businesses.    
So pl study for making community better.    
And you can sujjest before deny. What business can come in neighborhoods  
  
Thanks
