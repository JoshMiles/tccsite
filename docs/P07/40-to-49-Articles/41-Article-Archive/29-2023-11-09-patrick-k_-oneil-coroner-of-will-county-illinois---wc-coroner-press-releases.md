For Immediate Release:                     
  
The Will County Coroner’s Office announces that it is classifying the manner of death of the late Samantha Harer, 23, of Channahon, as a suicide.  
  
The Coroner’s office made this determination based upon a detailed review of all available evidence in the case. This included a review of autopsy and toxicology reports, police reports, DNA analysis, blood spatter analysis, medical records, and cell phone records. The coroner’s team also revisited the scene with investigators from the Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force.   
  
On February 13, 2018 Samantha Harer was transported from her residence by the Channahon Fire Department to the Presence St. Joseph Medical Center emergency room where she was pronounced deceased at 9:08 a.m.  
  
An autopsy was performed on February 14, 2018 that revealed Ms. Harer died from a single contact-range gunshot wound to her head at the right temple. Ms. Harer’s manner of death remained under investigation pending the outcome of the police investigation, crime lab results, and a consultation with an expert in the specialized field of blood spatter pattern analysis.  
  
This case was investigated by the Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force.   The Will County States Attorney’s office was consulted during the course of the investigation.
