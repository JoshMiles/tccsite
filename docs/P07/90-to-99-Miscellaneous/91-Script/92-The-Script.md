## Introduction  
  
montage of 911 call clips, and maybe an extract from Rachel's video.  
  
## Background  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) Grace Harer was born on the 25th of July 1994 in Channahon, Will County, Illinois.[^1]  
  
She had been the only child to her parents [Heather Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md.md.md) and [Kevin Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Kevin-Harer.md),[^2] and had grown up in Channahon, she had interned at Channahon's Police Department and had known everyone who had worked there.[^3]  
  
Her Mother had been a public librarian in Channahon, and her Father had worked as a carpenter in Romeoville - she maintained a close relationship with her parents throughout her life.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) attended Channahon high school in her youth before going on to initially study nursing at university, before dropping out and enrolling in a criminal justice degree.  
  
At Joliet's University of St. Francis, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) joined the Pi Sigma Alpha chapter and quickly found a bond with the sisterhood of the sorority.   
  
It had been her interest in the justice field that actually led her to take an emergency medical dispatch course in November of 2015, before going on to become an emergency dispatcher - serving her community.   
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) ended up graduating in May of 2016 with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, and she made sure to continue her work as an emergency dispatcher as she explored a post-graduate degree.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) was known as one of the hardest working and most dependable 911 dispatchers, and she got on well with her colleagues and the officers she liasoned with.   
  
Around May of 2017, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) began talking to a police officer by the name of [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), and in June of 2017, the pair went on their first date at the Grundy County Speedway in Morris.  
  
The date had actually been a double date with another Crest Hill police officer and a woman from the Wilmington Police Department.  
  
It's important to note that [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had been 10 years older than [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md), and he explained to her that he had been previously married in October of 2005.  
  
He had separated from his ex-wife in December of 2006, with the divorce finalising in June of 2007.  
  
Felipe also mentioned that he had been deployed to Iraq for about 10 months during his first marriage.  
  
The date with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) went well, with the pair hanging out all weekend and going with each other to a concert.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) went on a few more dates, soon entering into a relationship together.  
  
In September of 2017, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) discovered that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had actually been messaging with a married officer on the Plainfield Police Department.  
  
He had gone over to her apartment after work and had gone to put his watch on charge next to hers when he saw her watch, and looked through the messages on it.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and this married officer had chatted about how he wanted to go on vacation with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) so that he could "take care of her poolside".  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had been in the bedroom as [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had read through the messages, and when he confronted her she told him that she was remorseful about it, that she hadn't intended to hurt him and that she hadn't planned on going through with it.  
  
[Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) didn't end the relationship after that revelation, but he did take pictures of the flirty text messages with the intention of sending the images to the officer's wife - though he never did.  
  
In October of 2017, a Plainfield police officer brought a stray cat into the dispatcher centre and she fell in love with the black kitten instantly - adopting the cat and calling the kitten Salem.  
  
Outside of her career she had a huge passion for animals, in fact, she actually had a pet hedgehog at one point which she loved dearly.  
  
Three months later, in December of 2017, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) drove over to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s apartment when she hadn't been home, and he used her code to gain access - her front door lock had been one of those code pin pad locks rather than a key.  
  
[Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) allegedly had entered the apartment to retrieve a work shirt and had found [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s laptop to have been open, and when he took a closer look, he saw Facebook messages between [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and a Plainfield Community Service Officer.  
  
After this discovery, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) broke up the relationship with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) during the first week of December 2017.  
  
But the following week, the pair reconciled.  
  
They bought each other Christmas gifts that year:  
  
>[!quote] [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)  
>"She gave me a bunch of little small knickknacks and stuff, some whiskey glasses that had a 308 round in it, three zero eight, in it, and we kind of laughed because I bought her stemless wine glasses in the same nature,"  
>  
>"She got me ... this plaque that had a big eagle and anchor on it that said United States Marine Corps and my years of service, which was the most thoughtful gift I've ever gotten."  
  
And by January of 2018, the relationship had been back on track with the couple looking at purchasing a town house together.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had gone to the house inspection, and had made several trips to look at different flooring, light fixtures, paint and carpeting for the new house.  
## Lead up to Crime  
  
On the 11th of February 2018, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s Mother visited her at her apartment as [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had been asking friends and family for extra cardboard boxes in preparation for the move.  
  
[Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) hadn't been present when [Heather Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md.md) had been at the apartment, and when she left at about 10pm, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) hugged her Mother goodbye and said:   
  
>[!quote] [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to her Mother  
>"Don't forget, nail appointment and Taco Tuesdays".  
  
You see, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and her Mother would often meet up for tacos at [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents house, and they also went to get their nails painted together.  
  
Unbeknownst to [Heather Harer](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Heather-Harer.md.md.md), that would be the last exchange that she would have with her 23 year old daughter.  
  
After [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) finished his late-night patrol shift that same day, he drove over to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s apartment complex.  
  
He didn't let her know that he had been headed over, and drove by the apartment in the early hours of the [February 12 2018](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2018-2-12-Monday-February-12th-2018.md).  
  
[Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had allegedly been checking to see if [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) was okay, to see if there had been anything out of the ordinary, and when he saw just her vehicle in the car park, he went to a bar.  
  
He had tried texting [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) to see if she wanted him to come over, but she never responded to him and he just presumed that she had been sleeping.  
  
On that [Monday February 12th 2018](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2018-2-12-Monday-February-12th-2018.md.md), both [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had the day off work and so at around 11:30am, [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) decided to go over to her apartment, using the key code to go inside.  
  
He made his way to the bedroom to find her still asleep, gave her a kiss on the forehead then gave her the Valentine's gifts that he had bought for her as it had been the only day that they both had off that they could spend together- three cards and a couple boxes of chocolate.  
  
When [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) awoke, she put the gifts on the nightstand before telling [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) that she was tired and wanted to go back to sleep.  
  
And according to [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), there had been a gun located on the nightstand.  
  
It's unclear what the couple got up to that day, but what we do know is that [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) fell asleep on the living room couch between 7:30pm and 8:00pm that evening while he had been watching TV.  
  
[Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) woke up at about 3:30am on Tuesday the 13th of December 2018, and went to make a sandwich.  
  
He then checked in on [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) who had been sleeping soundly in her bedroom.  
  
It's important to note that it [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) then started messaging a friend who had been a police officer in Texas over the next few hours, in which some sources state that he had been upset and discussing [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s betrayals with him.  
## The Crime  
  
At around 7am, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) rose from bed and went to the bathroom.  
  
>[!quote]  
>"I said, 'Hi there, sleepyhead,'" Flores testified. "She looked at me and went into the bathroom."  
  
> [!quote]  
> "..she got back into the bed and covered herself up with the covers," Flores testified.   
  
When [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) got back into bed, she asked [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) for her cell phone which he claimed had been on the floor.  
  
He picked it up and handed it to her, and then the couple spoke more.  
  
> [!quote]  
> "She asked me what day it was. I said that it was Tuesday ... I was like, Samantha, it's Tuesday morning. Then I was walking to the doorway and she goes, well, that's what happens when you take 12 Xanax and pointing to her pill bottle on her dresser."  
  
It was at that point that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) got extremely angry with [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) and told him that he needed to leave.  
  
According to [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md), he had been clueless about why [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had been so mad with him.  
  
He pressed her on why she had taken 12 Xanax, raising his voice at her.  
  
The couple allegedly argued for about a minute in the bedroom.  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) continued to demand that [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) leave, and so he went into the living room to put on his shoes and clothes.  
  
According to [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md), at this point [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) slammed shut the bedroom door and locked it.  
  
And it was then that he heard the distinct sound of a gun racking, followed by a single shot.  
  
He then apparently ran to the bedroom door, trying to open it, but he couldn't get inbox.   
  
[Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) then pulled out his keys from his pocket, and used them to manipulate the door lock to be able to open it.  
  
When he pushed the door open, he saw 23 year old [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) in a seated position on her bedroom carpet with her back against one of the walls.  
  
That was when he dialled 911 at 8:19am.  
  
(911 call)  
## Investigation  
  
When the authorities arrived, they observed a gunshot wound to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s head, among other injuries, and the medical personnel actually detected a faint pulse.  
  
The paramedics rushed her to the hospital where, tragically, she passed away.  
  
Now interestingly, even though [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) told the police that he had been on the other side of the locked door when he had heard the firearm discharge, there had been blood splatter present on the front and right sleeve of his sweatshirt.  
  
Further, his white socks did not have any blood on them despite the fact that he told the 911 operator that he had been kneeling next to Samantha and talking to her while on the phone.  
  
An hour after the shooting, Channahon detective [Andrew McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md) was put in charge of the investigation and examined the scene.  
  
A forensic technician also examined the scene, and when this technician had been evaluating the blood splatter evidence, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) told him that [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) had rendered medical aid to [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) - which was flat out not true.  
  
Later legal proceedings would allege that [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) purposefully misled the technician in order to minimize the significance of blood splatter located on [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md)'s sweatshirt - why would he have blood splatter on his clothing if he hadn't been in the room when the shot was fired?  
  
On top of that, the investigators failed to question [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) on why [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had been found naked if the couple had been arguing prior to the shooting.  
  
According to court records, this alleged misconduct culminated in [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) either implicitly or explicitly instructing the technician to make a preliminary finding of suicide.  
  
And this technician complied and - without processing any forensic evidence or talking to [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md) or any other witness - determined that the scene had been consistent with a suicide.  
  
The following day, the investigators informed [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents that their daughter had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  
  
Importantly, the investigators failed to mention to her parents that a neighbour had actually heard a struggle shortly before the shooting, or that [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md)'s sweatshirt had blood splatter on it.  
  
Rather, they told them that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hand tested positive for gunshot residue, and that [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md)'s hands had tested negative.  
  
This was categorically not true.  
  
No test uncovered any gunshot residue on [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hands at all.  
  
In fact, tests actually revealed gunshot residue on [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md)'s right hand and on the front and on the cuffs of his sweatshirt.  
  
Though it must be noted that these tests were not conducted until months later.  
  
They told [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents that based on the 911 call and the text messages between [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) and [Felipe](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md.md), they had determined that her death was a suicide - though importantly the official cause and manner of death had not yet been actually determined.  
  
On that same day, Wednesday the 14th of February 2018, Joliet Patch published an indepth article in which it was reported that a former Crest Hill resident had actually obtained a protection order against Officer [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) accusing him of raping her while she had been asleep on the 6th of February 2016.  
  
And in the afternoon of that Wednesday, it was revealed that [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had been placed on administrative leave "due to the tragedy that happened yesterday."  
  
On Thursday the 15th of February 2018, a Plainfield police officer was interviewed and he told the investigators that he had spent time with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) outside of work, but hadn't seen her for nearly six months.

After this interview took place, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) promptly closed the investigation without ever addressing the matter with [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md).  
  
The police refused to communicate with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents, failing to even provide them with basic information about who was supervising the investigation.  
  
By the time Monday the 2nd of April 2018 came around, seven weeks after [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents had still been completely in the dark about what had happened - with no official cause or manner of death being ruled.  
  
And it was on that day that it was published that no charges were ever failed against [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) following the 2016 rape allegation, but that he did receive a month-long unpaid suspension before being re-instated to the police force.  
  
On Tuesday the 10th of April, Sgt Cary Morin finished his blood-stain analysis report.  
  
In this report, he stated that he arrived on the scene at 1:40pm, which is odd as the logs from the scene indicated that he didn't actually arrive and enter the apartment until 3:05pm.  
  
The report detailed that he had been brief by [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md).

> "The victim, while standing in the offset area of the bedroom near the door, facing east, suffered a perforating contact gunshot wound to the right side of the head," Morin noted. "The bedroom door was closed, either completely or mostly, evident by the bloodstain patterns located on the bedroom side of the door. The size of the offset area, along with the bloodstain patterns present and bullet trajectory suggest that the victim was standing alone in the bedroom offset area at the time of the incident."  
  
On Tuesday the 10th of July 2018, nearly six months after the death of [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md), [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) finally submitted [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)'s sweatshirt to the Illinois State Police's Forensic Science Centre in Chicago for examination.  
  
And on Saturday the 14th of July, nationally accredited forensic scientist Mary Wong began the forensic examinations and found a minimum of three tri-component primer gunshot residue particles from the gun shot residue tests performed back in February on [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)'s right hand.  
  
She also examined samples taken from [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hands at the hospital, and she determined there to have been no primer gunshot residue on [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s hands.

> "The results ... indicate that (Flores) discharged a firearm, contacted a PGSR related item or had his right hand in the environment of a discharged firearm,"  
  
On Wednesday the 29th of August 2018, forensic scientist Mary Wong completed her forensic examination of [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md)'s sweatshirt and found primer gunshot residue particles on his right cuff, left cuff and chest area.  
  
In an act of desperation, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents hired an attorney to help them get answers to their questions about their daughter's death - suing [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md), Crest Hill and Channahon in federal court for conspiracy and excessive force.  
  
Though just one day after filing the federal lawsuit, on Sunday the 14th of October 2018, the attorney that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents had hired actually had his law licence suspended for 90 days which he failed to disclose to them when they hired him.  
  
They decided that the only way forward would be to drop their federal lawsuit.  
  
A hearing was scheduled for December 13th 2018, and due to them lacking legal representation, they did not attend the hearing.  
  
The court then rescheduled the hearing and admonished [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents to    
  
>[!quote]  
>"Appear at the 1/22/2019 hearing or this case will be dismissed for want of prosecution."  
  
On Thursday the 31st of October 2018, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) submitted the sexual assault evidence kit that had been collected at the time of [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death to the Joliet Forensic Science Lab.  
  
Importantly, [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) only submitted the kit for selective testing.  
  
On Wednesday the 20th of November 2018, Bill Cheng from science lab concluded the sexual assault kit testing and determined there to have been no semen present on the vaginal, anal and oral swabs.  
  
Though it must be noted that [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) had not asked Bill Cheng to examine [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s head hair combings, pubic hair combings, fingernail combings, and similar evidence.  
  
In Bill Cheng's report, he noted:

On Thursday the 13th of December 2018, Will County's State Attorney staff asked [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) to re-interview the Plainfield officer that had known [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
The officer described [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) as    
  
>[!quote]  
>"(A) very positive person, funny, good person and flirtatious" but denied having any intimate relations with her, stating that he was "happily married"  
  
6 days later, on the 19th of December, the Will County State's Attorney Officer directed the detectives to look for the missing bullet that ha  d killed [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md), which is a bit wild considering the bullet had gone through her apartment wall way back in February 10 months earlier.  
  
The search for the bullet lasted one day.  
  
Seven officers with metal detectors canvassed the property.  
  
> [!quote]  
>  "No bullet projectiles or fragments of bullet projectiles were located. No defects were found in any tree or wooded brush consistent with projectile strike, nor was any bullet projectile or fragments of bullet projectiles found in any tree or wood brush,"  
  
10 months and nine days after the shooting, the crime scene photographer produced his written summary in which he opined that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had killed herself.  
  
>[!quote]  
>"With the blood patterns on the wall and floor we could approximate how the decedent came to rest on the floor. The blood spatter evidence was consistent with this being a self-inflicted wound to the head made by a right-handed person,"  
  
On the 28th of December 2018, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents met with Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md), his deputy Adam Bogart, a coroner, a prosecutor, and counsel for Channahon Police Department.  
  
Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and Deputy Bogart informed [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents that they had officially ruled [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s death as a suicide, basing their decision on forensic evidence that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted.  
  
Further, they told them that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s toxicology report also pointed to suicide.  
  
It was at this point that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents asked when they could receive and inspect their daughter's belongings, to which they were told they could retrieve the property upon the dismissal of their civil lawsuit.  
  
On top of that, the police department refused to provide them with any investigative materials until after the dismissal of their lawsuit.  
  
That same day, the Chief published a press release that stated:  
  
>[!quote]  
>"The Channahon Police Department in conjunction with the Major Crimes Task Force and the Will County State’s Attorney’s Office conducted a comprehensive death investigation spanning over 10 months, involving multiple law enforcement agencies."  
>  
>"The Will County Coroner has determined that Samantha's cause of death was by a self-inflicted gunshot wound"  
>  
>"That finding is consistent with, and supported by the evidence presented by this multi-jurisdictional investigation."  
  
The Crest Hill Police Chief Ed Clark also issued a press release in which he complimented the Channahon Police Department for conducting a:  
  
>[!quote]  
>"lengthy and thorough investigation from which (Officer Phil Flores) was cleared from any criminal involvement in the death of Samantha Harer ... We acknowledge the length of time involved in conducting a complete and thorough and transparent examination of the facts surrounding this case and support the process to review Officer Flores' association."  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents, under the belief that the official finding that the cause of death had been suicide now barred their pending lawsuit from proceeding, did not show up to court for the January 22nd 2019 status hearing and subsequently, the court dismissed the case.  
  
It was only after the dismissal did her parents learn that the gunshot residue analysis implicated [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) and not their daughter, and that Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md) and Deputy Bogart's statements about [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s toxicology report had also been false.  
  
The results, in actual fact, had been inconsistent with suicide.  
  
On the 29th of January 2019, it was published by Joliet Patch that a next door neighbour to Samantha was awoken between 8 and 8:15am on the morning of the shooting:  
  
>[!quote]  
>"by someone banging on the wall or someone slamming the door in the apartment next door, which is the victim's apartment. He then heard (the) female yell, 'Let me go" two or three times coming from the same apartment,"  
  
[Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents then hired new counsel who moved swiftly to vacate the judgement of the dismissal.  
  
On Wednesday the 20th of February 2019, civil rights attorney Jennifer Bonjean asked a federal judge in Chicago to revive the recently dismissed lawsuit.  
  
>[!quote]  
> "On January 29, 2019, Plaintiffs were devastated to learn that the law enforcement officials who had investigated Samantha's death flat-out lied to them. John Ferak, a reporter for the Joliet Patch published an article based on documents received through FOIA requests that strongly suggests that Samantha's manner of death was not suicide but rather homicide,"  
  
A week later, on the 27th of February, a law firm hired by Channon Police Department filed nearly 50 pages to support their finding that [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md) had taken her own life.  
  
>[!quote]  
> "With regard to the positive (primer gunshot residue) test on Flores, it has been suggested that this could have been the result of him being in the room where the gun was discharged immediately after Samantha was shot. This would be consistent with his statement that he was in the room with Samantha immediately after she was shot and lifted her head at some point,"  
  
On Friday the 22nd of March 2019, the Crest Hill Police Chief told Joliet Patch that [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had not longer been with his police department, and that he hadn't worked a single day as a police officer since the shooting of [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
It was revealed that he had collected more than $90,000 in paid suspension during that time.

>   
> "We accept his resignation which is effective immediately."  
  
On the 8th of May 2019, Patch published information that despite the fact that [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) had been cleared in [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s case, privately, the Crest Hill Police Department had been building a case to bring his career to an end with 11 separate alleged violations brought against him.  
  
When [Felipe Flores](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Felipe-Flores.md.md) was notified that a termination hearing would take place in six days, back in March, he had chosen to resign instead.  
  
And on the 28th of May 2019, a federal judge in Chicago allowed attorney Bonjean to re-file a civil rights police misconduct lawsuit on behalf of [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents.

On the 9th of June 2019, a good friend of mine Rachel Shannon posted a YouTube video covering the case up until that point. I've linked her video down below if you wanted to go check it out as Rachel's sister went to high school with [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md).  
  
On the 12th of June, attorney Bonjean accused Chief [Shane Casey](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Shane-Casey.md.md), Deputy Bogart and [Detective McClellan](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Andrew-McClellan.md.md) of "of orchestrating a cover-up and conducting a faulty police investigation to ensure Harer's February 2018 death was not treated as a homicide."  
  
Attorney Bonjean then asked a federal judge in Chicago to allow to to amend the lawsuit to include the three high-ranking members of the police department as co-defendants.  
  
And on the 22nd of July, the federal judge sided with attorney Bonjean and permits the addition of the three of them.

On Thursday the 14th of November 2019, US District Judge Robert Gettlemen published his pre-trial ruling.  
  
And in this ruling he basically told the defendants to stop trying to get the federal lawsuit brought against them dismissed.  
  
>[!quote]  
>"The Channahon defendants should stop wasting private and judicial resources by repeating arguments that this court has already rejected and start litigating this case on the merits,"  
  
On the 12th of June 2020, the district court filed an opinion in the case and essentially they disposed of the federal claims and relinquished jurisdiction over the case after dismissing the federal charge in the lawsuit.  
  
In October 2022, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents re-filed their lawsuit in state court.   
  
Let's take a look at the ruling court document.  
  
Their complaint asserts three counts:  
1.  Wrongful Death;   
2. Intentional infliction of Emotional Distress (suffered by the Harers); and   
3. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (suffered by Samantha).  
  
Felipe was personally served with a summons and a copy of the Complaint on December  
15, 2022.   
  
In February 2023, [Samantha](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Samantha-Harer.md.md)'s parents’ counsel requested that Felipe be defaulted for failure to appear and answer.   
  
The Court granted that motion.  
  
In March 2023, Felipe appeared through counsel and requested that the default be vacated and that he be given leave to answer.  
  
The Court granted that routine request, given that Illinois reviewing courts have repeatedly held that the interests of justice dictate, in all cases, that resolution on the merits is preferred over a resolution based on technical or procedural grounds.  
  
However, no answer was filed and, in April 2023, Felipe’s attorneys withdrew from the case.   
  
On April 24, 2023, with Felipe present, the Court advised that if Felipe did not file a formal appearance by the next court date, he would be defaulted again.  
  
In May 2023, the parties again appeared for case management.  
  
Felipe was present, but still had not filed an answer either pro se or through counsel.  
  
The Court defaulted Felipe again, and advised him that the Court would not entertain a motion to vacate the default unless that motion included (as an exhibit) a proposed answer or other pleading, and a formal appearance.  
  
On June 30, 2023, the case was before the Court for a hearing on damages. Felipe was  
physically present in the courtroom. The Court asked Felipe if he wished to say anything before  
the hearing. The Court did this with the expectation that Felipe might ask to vacate the default,  
or might ask for additional time, or might explain his difficulties in complying with the Court's  
scheduling orders. Instead, Felipe stated that he had done nothing wrong, and he abruptly left  
the courtroom. Since Felipe received notice and had the opportunity to participate, and also  
because he had the opportunity to request a continuance or other relief but made no such  
request, the hearing proceeded in his absence with regard to damages.  
  
Specifically, Plaintiffs presented the following unrefuted evidence at the prove-up  
hearing: Testimony from Heather and Kevin Harer; Testimony from Dan Grubisich an EMT from  
the Channahon Fire Protection District, Sergeant Cary Morin of the Illinois State Police Division  
of Criminal Investigations, and Dr. Karl Reich, an expert in the field of DNA analysis.  
  
‘The Harers’ evidence established as follows.  
  
Minutes before Samantha was shot, a neighbor heard banging sounds and yelling coming from the apartment, with a woman screaming “let me go.”  
  
Samantha was found shot in her bedroom; she was naked at the time.  
  
Felipe apparently told authorities that he was in the living room at the time of the gunshot. A  
large dent was present in the drywall, which was consistent with the notion of a struggle from  
within the apartment; the dent was not there the prior day. Felipe had blood spatter and  
gunshot residue on his right hand and on the right arm of his sweatshirt, while gunshot residue  
was not found on Samantha's hand. The gun that killed Samantha had substantial elements of  
Felipe’s DNA (18 of 20 DNA markers, with the other two being partial markers that did not  
exclude Felipe).  
  
Applying the preponderance standard, the Court finds that the foregoing evidence  
contradicts the notion that Felipe was outside the bedroom when Samantha was shot, and  
further contradicts the notion that she shot herself. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that  
Felipe likely shot and killed Samantha. The Harers have adequately proven the elements of  
their claims for wrongful death and emotional distress against Samantha.  
  
Likewise, the Court finds that the Harers have adequately proved the elements of their  
own claim for emotional distress, The Court finds Samantha had a strong and enduring  
relationship with her parents and had lived with them until moving out less than a year before  
she died. She spent time with them regularly and communicated with them on a near-daily  
basis, Samantha was a strong student, a devoted daughter, and hard worker. The Harers  
described Samantha as strong-willed and denied that she was in a depressed or suicidal mental  
state at the time of her death. Samantha had made an appointment to finish a tattoo on the  
afternoon of her death. Samantha played a critical role in helping her parents in any number of  
tasks, including by assisting her mother in her fight against Cancer. To be sure, the Harers have  
suffered unimaginable pain and suffering since Samantha's passing.  
  
The evidence demonstrates that Felipe made offensive and harmful physical contact  
with Samantha, without valid cause, The conduct was undertaken with reckless and intentional  
disregard to Samantha's life. As a direct and proximate cause of Felipe’s misconduct, Samantha  
suffered severe physical and emotional injuries, including death. In summary, the Court finds  
that Felipe likely caused Samantha's death.  
  
Further, as a result of Felipe’s reckless and intentional misconduct, the Harers suffered  
loss of Samantha's care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, and counsel.  
They also suffered severe mental anguish resulting from her death.  
  
It must be noted that: The Court's findings today do not constitute a criminal conviction. The Court is mindful that a criminal  
charge entails a high standard of proof (ie., beyond a reasonable doubt), whereas a civil case typicaly entalis a  
preponderance standard. But, even under a dear and convincing standard, if it applied, the Court's ruling today  
‘would be unchanged. Further, the Court takes no position on whether Felipe ought to be charged; that is not the  
Court’s decision to make. Besides, the Court is not in a position to understand why Felipe was not charged with  
Samantha's death, as no one from the Channahon Police Department, nor the coroner's office, nor other law  
enforcement authorities, testified to explain their perspective as to why Samantha's death might have been 3  
suicide.  
  
Based on the foregoing, the Court enters judgment in favor of Heather and Kevin Harer,  
and against Felipe “Phil” Flores, on all counts. The Court awards the Harers compensatory  
damages in the amount of $15,000,000 ($10,000,000 for Count |; $2,500,000 for Count Il; and  
$2,500,000 for Count II!).
