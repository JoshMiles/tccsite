Obstruct justice by attempting to escape detention, arrest, and punishment by providing a false story to law enforcement, the Rowan County Department of Social Services, and the media, that [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was alive and living with her grandmother, when in fact the defendant knew at the time that [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was deceased.

The defendant committed this act with deceit and with the intent to defraud.
