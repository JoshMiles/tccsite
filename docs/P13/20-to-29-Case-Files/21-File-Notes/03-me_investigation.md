## Medical Examiner Preliminary Summary of Circumstances Surrounding Death  
  
According to the information received from the Rowan County Sheriff's Office, [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), was reported missing by a juvenile family member of 2013-07-30 who stated she had been missing since December 2011 when she was reportedly sent to live with her grandmother.  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) would have been 13 years old at the time the report was filed.  
  
Investigators were led to an area where the body was buried in SC.  
  
Digging in the area has produced some skeletal remains, believed to be human.  
  
She had been buried, naked, so no clothing found.  
  
[Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) will transport her tomorrow and will have dental records and DNA samples for testing if necessary.
