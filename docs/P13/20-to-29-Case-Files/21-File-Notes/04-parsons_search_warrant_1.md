- [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) was unable to provide investigators with any contact information for the person she delivered [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) to. ^l-yv1

- During the course of the investigation, Sheriff's investigators began speaking with other family members of [Casey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) concerning [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).  
- These interviews confirmed that [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) has been missing from this family since around Christmas 2011.  
- Written and signed statements of more than five of these family members revealed a troubled relationship with [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md).  
- In these statements, [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) is described as very small for her age and rarely interacting with the family and extended family.  
- Several of these statements describe [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) as abusive and described [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) telling family members that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was grounded or being disciplined for something.  
- [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was often made to stand in a corner while being punished.  
- The family members stated [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) always seemed to be "grounded" and never allowed to interact with the family.  
- In a statement another child in the home told the family member that [Casey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) took a toy gun and broke it while hitting [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) with the toy.  
- The child was upset because the toy gun was their favourite toy.  
- This statement also stated that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) told family members that she couldn't tolerate [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), that she does not claim [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) as her daughter.  
- In another statement, investigators were told that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) told a family member that she can't stand to look at [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) and said she reminds her of [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) and she hates [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md).  
- These statements also described consistently seeing bruises and bumps on [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s arms and legs that made them feel [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was being struck by family members.  
- [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) also blamed these marks on another child in the family.  
  
- That when [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was six years old [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) called family members and asked them to take [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) because she couldn't stand to look at her.  
- [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) brought the child to a family member's house to live and showed them bruises that were described as "all over Erica's butt".  
- This family member stated [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) said she lost control and beat her.  
- [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) lived with this family member for about 8 months.  
- This family member stated to investigators that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was very small and was in first grade and wore "3T" size clothes.  
- While living with this family member, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) ate and played like normal and began to gain weight.  
- While [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) stayed with this family they stated [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) told them that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) hit her.  
- This family member said that after about 8 months [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) came and took [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) back and stated she was afraid that DSS would find out she didn't have her and she was still getting money for her.  
  
- During the course of this investigation, investigators spent time speaking with family members and searching for possible leads about the location of [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).  
- [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) held more than one interview with the local news media.  
- During these public news conferences, this applicant noted that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) often referred to [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) in the past tense when [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) stated "She was a teenager" and "She was with her grandparent".  
- I found these statements to be inconsistent since the Parsons claim to have left Erica alive, well and happy with her biological grandmother.  
- In comparison, [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) ([Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s biological mother) also spoke to news reporters by phone and spoke of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) in the present tense as in on quote saying "She is my biological daughter. I want her to know that I do still love her".  
- These statements were reported on television WBTV news on August 5th, 2013.  
- The choice of [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) to not speak to investigators without an attorney and the decision to speak with television reporters seemed unusual.  
  
- That I made a check of the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles and discovered [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) at 218 Miller Chapel Road, Salisbury had a 2005 Dodge Caravan displaying NC registration AHB1342.
