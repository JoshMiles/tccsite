## Intro  
Tuesday the 30th of July 2013.  
  
Rowan County Sheriff's Office, North Carolina.  
  
Two young men enter the police station to report their adopted younger sister as missing.  
  
But when the investigators ask them when she went missing, and the two young men tell them they last saw their 13 year old sister two years ago, a twisted case of lies, fraud, abuse and murder begins to unravel.  
  
(A montage of clips from the news broadcast / raw footage)  
  
## Theme  
  
Usual theme.  
  
## Background  
  
[Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was born on the 28th of February 1998 to her biological mother [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md)[^1], weighing just 4lbs and 7oz.[^2]  
  
Sadly, within days of giving birth to [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) realised that she couldn't care for her newly born daughter.[^3]  
  
You see, [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) tragically did not have the money to look after [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), and so she knew that she needed to give her baby up for adoption.[^4]  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was described has being a happy baby, who [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) could cuddle up to and who would fall straight to sleep.[^5]  
  
And [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s biological father had not been in the picture[^6], so [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md)'s former brother-in-law and sister-in-law [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) offered to adopt [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^7]  
  
[Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) had spent her childhood in foster care and she knew from the moment she first held her daughter that she wanted more for her[^8], and she felt that [Casey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) adopting [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) would grant her daughter [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) a life and home that she couldn't provide for her.[^9]  
  
And so, at four weeks old[^10], [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was adopted by [Casey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and joined their family.[^11]  
  
It's unclear when exactly [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) met, and when they got married, but what we do know is that on the 8th of May, 1992,[^12] [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) gave birth to the couple's first child - Sandy Wade Parsons Jr[^13] - in Concord, North Carolina.[^14]  
  
And the following year, on the 24th of March 1993, the couple's second son, [James Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-James-Parsons.md) (known as Jamie) was born in China Grove, North Carolina.[^15]  
  
In 1994, it was reported in my sources that evidence of violence had emerged within the family home, violence which ultimately saw [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) being found guilty of assaulting his wife [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and being ordered to serve three years probation.[^16]  
  
The judge also ordered [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) to not assault, harass or molest [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md).[^17]  
  
The couple seemingly remained together after these charges and rulings had been made, with them welcoming their third child the following year in 1995 - a daughter by the name of [Brook Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Brook-Parsons.md).[^18]  
  
On the 15th of November of that same year, 1995, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) underwent an operation to get tubal ligation, in other words she got her tubes tied.[^19]  
  
Not much else is known about what happened within the family from that point, up until 1997 that is.  
  
In 1997, [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) was once again charged with and convicted of assault against his wife [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md), and is subsequently sentenced to a year probation and ordered to undergo community service.[^20]  
  
And with that second conviction in 1997 of assault, both [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) are still granted the adoption of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) by the state when it is approved by Cabarrus County on the 23rd of March in the year 2000.[^21]  
  
The state found that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) were   
  
"fit to have care and custody of said child"  
  
  
.[^22]  
  
It must be noted that [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) would actually claim that the official adoption had gone through in July of the year 2000 rather than in the March, but whatever the case, the couple were still granted custody of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^23]  
  
Here's what [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) said about the adoption:  
  
>[!quote] [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md)  
>"We got her at 4 weeks old, she was placed with us, but she wasn't legally adopted until July 2000, she was 2-1/2 years old."  
  
>[!quote] [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md)  
>"Erica has 3 half siblings that also got at the same time. We had 7 kids, 3 of our biological kids and 4 that we got in at the time when we got her. And we had them 7 kids all the way up until August 1998 when the other 3 were placed with other adopted families that they did get adopted with and we already had her for weeks, and she was already calling me mama and we couldn't let her go at that point so we, the social workers agreed to, we were the ones who learned her how to walk and talk and we were the only parents she knew at that point, and she called us mama and daddy."  
  
In 2001, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) advertised herself online as a surrogate mother, and it had been online where she had met [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) - a mother who would hire [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) to be her surrogate.[^24]  
  
[Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) hired [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) on the 27th of August 2001, and this is what [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) would later say about [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md):[^25]  
  
>[!quote]  
>"She just seemed very wholesome. Very down to Earth. Very religious. The fact that she adopted Erica to keep her in the family, I thought that was a real, you know, that was admirable is what I thought. "  
  
In September of 2001, [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md)'s embryo was transferred into [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md)' uterus.[^26]  
  
>[!quote] [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md)  
>"She came to my house. Her and her son, Jamie, stayed for 3 weeks. We got the positive pregnancy. She went back (home)"  
  
Though, when [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) was six weeks along, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) rung up [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) and told her that she had sadly miscarried and lost the baby.[^27]  
  
Strangely, shortly after informing [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) of the miscarriage, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) changed her phone number and her email address, and began to send [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) nasty emails telling her that she would never get doctor records from her to prove that she had miscarried, and that she was glad that it hadn't worked out.[^28]  
[^29]  
  
>[!quote] [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md)  
>"She changed her phone number. She changed her email. She told me I needed to get a life. I had no business having a child."  
  
About six months after [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had allegedly miscarried, [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) logged onto a surrogacy website and came across a message that had been posted by one of [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md)' family members that said: [^30]  
  
>[!quote]  
>Looking for the Michigan couple that worked with Casey, I have some wonderful news for you.  
  
This family member revealed to [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had still been pregnant and that she had set up a crib in her bedroom and had been planning on keeping the baby.[^31]  
  
Once it had been confirmed that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had still been pregnant with [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md)'s child, an investigation was launched.[^32]  
  
[Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) learnt that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had actually been taking money from at least two other couples while she had been pregnant.[^33]  
  
It had been [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md)'s belief that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had set out to steal her child.[^34]  
  
Legal action was immediately threatened against [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md), and the FBI was informed of the situation, which ultimately saw [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) doing the right thing and giving [Amy Miller](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/01-Amy-Miller.md) her child after the birth.[^35]  
  
>[!quote]  
>"[Questions were raised] about Casey Parsons' role and motives as a surrogate mother, under an agreement she had made with a couple from another state. In a letter, the couple's attorney said that they had learned that Parsons had told the couple that she had lost her baby to a miscarriage, and that wasn't true. The attorney also said that they had evidence that Parsons was "shopping" their unborn child, trying to find other prospective parents who would pay for the child. The attorney told the Parsons that the FBI had been notified and that they could be prosecuted for kidnapping if they tried to keep the child."  
  
In March of 2002, the Department of Social Services began investigating allegations that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had been abused in the home two years previously, when she had been two years old.[^36]  
  
The Department of Social Services, or DSS, began to investigate a report that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had been hit with a belt which had left bruises.[^37]  
  
The person who had filed the report with DSS had claimed that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) would carry a belt around with her and used that belt to whip [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^38]  
  
The allegation had been that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had beaten [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) who had sustained marks on her buttocks, one on the back of her leg and a couple to the side of her face.[^42]  
  
Further, it was alleged that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) wouldn't eat food, and that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had said that she didn't love her.[^43]  
  
When the DSS interviewed [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md), she denied abusing her children and the DSS investigator made note that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) did not appear to have been afraid of either of her parents and that she would sit on their laps without hesitation.[^39]  
  
Further, the DSS worker found no signs of cuts, bruises or scratches on [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), though it was noted that she had been a small 4 year old that weighed just 41 lbs.[^40]  
  
And so the DSS case concluded with a safety plan being agreed to by [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) in which they agreed to use alternate forms of discipline such as timeouts and groundings, and agreed not to leave any marks or bruises from spanking and to provide a safe stable home for the children.[^44]  
  
On the 1st of March 2003, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) travelled to Mexico to have her tubes untied which she documented in a blog post she posted online.[^41]  
  
In August of that same year, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) began attending Bostian Elementary School in China Grove, where she would be a student until July of 2004.  
  
A member of staff from the school spoke with the media about [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) and said:  
  
>[!quote]  
>"I remember that I saw her individually sometime. I remember her smile and how she brushed her bangs out of her eyes if she felt anxious," the staffer wrote to WBTV. "She would beam when praised and she was hesitant when she thought she might not know the answer to a question -- that's when she would brush her bangs away from her eyes and puff air out of her mouth. I recall how she tilted her head to one side and would smile and that she loved stickers."  
  
In January of 2004, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) made a post on her website that she had found out she was pregnant, with a due date of the 11th of September of that same year.[^45]  
  
It had also been in 2004 when another DSS complaint was filed against [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md).[^46]  
  
The authorities responded to the family home within 24 hours, and spoke with the parents and the children.[^47]  
  
It had been reported that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was very tiny and frail, and that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) didn't want [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) anymore and had tried to give her away.[^48]  
  
The parents denied to DSS that they used any corporal punishment, but that they would both holler at their children and would rather raise their voices than whip the children.  
  
They explained that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) would throw up food if she didn't like it, and was seeing a doctor for gastro issues.[^49]  
  
Both of the parents denied threatening to take food away from [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) or saying that they didn't care if she ate again, and they stated that they never tried to give [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) away.[^50]  
  
When the social workers interviewed [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) alone, they noted that she presented as small for her age.[^51]  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) told this social worker that when she does something bad, she has time out or isn't allowed to do certain things, and if she does something really bad, she might get a whipping.[^52]  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) also told the social worker that she likes to eat macaroni and pizza.[^53]  
  
Notably, the social worker observed [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) to have been well bonded with both [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and that she presented as a happy child.[^54]  
  
Ultimately, the DSS case ended with a safety plan being agreed with the parents that they must agree to seek medical attention if the child continues to have eating problems, or does not advance developmentally.[^55]  
  
Though, the investigators also found substantiated neglect due to necessary medical/remedial care not being provided, and so [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was placed with an Aunt.[^56]  
  
This aunt noted that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had been very small, and that she had been in the first grade and worse 3T sized clothes.[^58]  
  
As [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) lived with this aunt, she began to eat and play normally and began to gain weight.[^59]  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) also revealed to this aunt that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) hit her.[^60]  
  
Importantly, this aunt never tried to gain legal custody of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) which meant that 8 months later, when [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) wanted [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) back, they were granted custody again.[^57]  
  
That same year, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) began to attend Shadybrook Elementary School.[^61]  
  
And on the 20th of August of 2004, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) gave birth to her daughter, Sadia.[^62]  
  
A year later, in 2005, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) posts online that she lost a baby in August, but that she was no pregnant again with a due date for June 10th 2006.[^63]  
  
And in September of 2005, it emerged that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had owned and was running a company called Carolina Tailwaggers which, according to some sources, had been a Chihuahua puppy mill - though not much information is available about this.[^64]  
  
In November, it is reported that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) began to get home-schooled at the Parsons Christian Home School.[^65]  
  
You see, on the 21st of November, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) opened the Parson's Christian School as a religious school located at their home address, with [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) as the chief administrator.[^66]

>   Casey Parsons also did not file the scores on the annual achievement test the students were required to take. In fact, Mears said, the state has no way of knowing whether the Parsons Christian School still exists."  
  
After [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) began her home school education, information about what she got up to and her home life is sparse.  
  
That was until 2010 when this picture of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was taken.[^67]  
  
On the 4th of February of 2010, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s adoptive older brother [James Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-James-Parsons.md), known as Jamie, was charged at the age of 16 by China Grove Police for misdemeanour simple assault for biting his 3 year old brother on the arm to "see if he could bring blood to the surface."[^68]  
  
That brings us to that day in July, the 30th, in 2013, when [James Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-James-Parsons.md) walked into the Rowan County Sheriff's office and reported [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) as missing, let's take a listen to how he described what he said to the police that day.

Jamie Parsons told them that in December 2011. His parents told him Erica had gone to visit her biological grandmother. Jamie says the story seemed strange, and he recalls his father. Sandy seemed distraught.

He was whiter than a piece of paper. He wasn't.. he.. all the color in his skin had gone, all the color.

00:00:34:14 - 00:00:41:00  
Speaker 1  
He told me his thoughts went to the previous night. The last time he had seen Erica.

00:00:41:03 - 00:00:59:03  
Speaker 6  
She was gray. She couldn't really breathe. She was tired, and she... she told Casey “I can't breathe.” and Casey told her to shut the f- up and get back in the corner. And I woke up the next day, and Erica was gone.  
  
When [James Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-James-Parsons.md) had awoken in November or December of 2011, and realised [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) - who had been 13 years old at the time -was not at the home, he grew worried.[^69]  
  
And so he asked his parents [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) where his sister [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was, and they told him that they had been to Asheville, North Carolina, and given [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) to her biological grandmother - a woman by the name of [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) and who was known as Nan or Nana.[^70]  
  
He explained to the police that was the last time he had seen his sister.  
  
An investigation into the disappearance of [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was immediately launched by the authorities.

We searched every square inch of that house. They pulled up floorboards in the err, some of the closets, doing probes in the yard, looking for, clandestine graves. And every place that we knew they'd been, we'd searched, they-they had moved a lot.

Got calls all over the place from psychics, people seeing her on the side of the road, or I thought I saw her here. And it's hard when you can't tell the public and the national news and the local news and state news.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created an age progression photo, turning an image of Erica at age nine into what she could look like at 15. Those pictures were plastered on billboards. Part of the massive effort to generate tips.

00:01:08:15 - 00:01:11:19  
Speaker 2  
This case would haunt us if we didn't find her.  
  
When the authorities spoke with [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md), they claimed that they had last seen [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) in December of 2011 in Moorsville at a McDonalds.[^71]  
  
And they told the investigators that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s biological grandmother, [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md), had contacted them via Facebook and had asked them whether she could start a relationship with [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) - her granddaughter.[^72]  
  
[Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) claimed that they let [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) take [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) to Asheville, but that they hadn't seen her since.[^73]  
  
They told the authorities that they had gone with their daughter [Brook Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Brook-Parsons.md) to take [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) to meet with [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md), though it must be noted that when the investigators spoke with [Brook Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Brook-Parsons.md), she stated that she had stayed home with the other children.[^81]  
  
Further, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) were unable to provide the investigators with any contact information for [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md), they couldn't even provide the profile of [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) on Facebook which they alleged she had used to originally contact them.[^82]  
  
[Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) had been the lead detective on the case, and he was quickly tasked with trying to track down [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) so that they could check on the wellbeing of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).  
  
He started by trying to locate anyone with the name [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md), or similar names, who lived in Asheville and while there had been people that had the name, none of them had been related to [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^74]  
  
According to one source, on the 31st of July, the two youngest children in the Parsons family home were removed by the state - but I was unable to find any more information in this.[^77]  
  
[Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) then made the announcement in August of 2013 that the police believed the story about [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s biological grandmother had been fake, and that they had tracked down everyone with the name Goodman in Asheville but couldn't find [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) or her biological grandmother.[^75]  
  
The investigator also made a point to state that [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) were not cooperating with the authorities in their announcement.[^78]  
  
On the 12th of August, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s biological mother [Carolyn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Carolyn-Parsons.md) flew from New Orleans to North Carolina in order to speak with the investigators about [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s disappearance, and it was on that same day that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) filmed a segment in LA for the Dr Phil Show.[^79]  
  
And in September of 2013, a month after the investigators had revealed that [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) didn't actually exist, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) decided to allow the media to enter her home which gives us a glimpse of the environment in which [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) would have lived in.[^76]  
  
(brief clip from part 2)  
  
Now as I just briefly mentioned, [Casey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) went on the Dr Phil show in order to discuss their case, and unfortunately I'm unable to show clips from the episode in this video due to Dr Phil's team being very strict on their copyright but what we will do is go over the main points from the segment.  
  
[Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) claimed on the show that [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had cut off communications with them.[^80]  
  
Apparently, [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) had told [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had said that she didn't want to go back home after having lived with [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md) for two months, and about a week and a half later when [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) tried to call [Irene Goodman](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Irene-Goodman.md), the phone line stated that the number was not receiving calls.[^83]  
  
This lead [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) to believe that 13 year old [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had blocked their number.[^84]  
  
Both [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) insisted on the show that they believe that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) is fine and that they don't have a doubt in their minds about it.[^85]  
  
They reiterated that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was not missing, and that they thought she was just being a rebellious teenager.[^86]  
  
The couple further claimed that they believed that they had been the model parents, and that all of their kids needs were met.[^87]  
  
But the detectives on the case knew deep down that something wasn't adding up, that the couple were hiding something, and they knew that all they had to do was separate the couple and soon one of them would break so that they could learn the truth and find [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^88]  
  
If they weren't together, they wouldn't talk, and the authorities got the impression that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had some kind of control over [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md).[^89]  
  
But separating the couple seemed like a task next to impossible.  
  
That was until the investigators uncovered a major mistake that the couple had made.  
  
A mistake with their money.[^90]  
  
As it turned out, [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had been collecting adoption assistance and food stamps - programmes that receive federal funding - benefits that were intended for [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).  
  
And despite them not having custody of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) for two years, they had still been collecting those benefits.[^91]  
  
>[!quote]  
>[Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had been "working together to enrich themselves with [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s benefits"  
  
This meant that the FBI was now involved and investigating the Parsons for benefits fraud.  
  
And in 2014, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) were arrested on 76 counts of federal fraud charges and identity theft.  
  
Notably, members of the jury stated that they didn't buy [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md)'s defence that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had been the mastermind being the benefits fraud and that he didn't have any knowledge of the household finances.[^92]  
  
And in March of 2015, the couple were finally separated and imprisoned with a combined 18 years of federal prison time.[^93]  
  
Though, tragically, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) remained missing.  
  
That was until 2016, when a crucial break in the case was made.[^94]  
  
From behind the bars of his jail cell, and after more than three years of fabricating the truth, [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) finally broke and came clean.  
  
He confessed to the investigators that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had tragically been dead for five years, passing away when she was 13 years old.[^95]  
  
In September of 2016, [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) was escorted with the authorities to rural Chesterfield in South Carolina, which had been an area where [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) (his wife) had once lived) in order for [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) to locate [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s body.[^96]  
  
You can see in this footage [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) being taken to the location where he claimed [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s body was.  
  
We see him confirm the spot.  
  
He gets out, and within three minutes, he's able to locate the shallow grave where he and his wife [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had discarded the remains of 13 year old [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).[^97]  
  
According to [Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md), [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) became sombre and tearful.[^98]  
  
[Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) confession also revealed the extreme measures that he and his wife and gone to in order to hide the death of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) back in December of 2011.[^99]  
  
This is his version of events.  
  
It had been in December of 2011 when [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) had woken up to [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) telling him that [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had died.[^100]  
  
[Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) told [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) that she had placed [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) inside of a tote in a plastic container.[^101]  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) would remain in that plastic container for two days while [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) and [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) decided what to do with her remains.[^102]  
  
In the meantime, the family continued on as normal and even went to a Christmas party.[^103]  
  
This receipt that I'm showing on screen right now shows bleach that the couple had purchased and used to pour over [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains after her death.[^104]  
  
And it's important to note that the couple actually visited the road in Chesterfield County where they'd leave [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains in a shallow grace twice.  
  
The first time had been to dig the grave, the second time to abandon her remains there.[^105]  
  
The couple had even removed the batteries from their cell phones when they went to the burial location to avoid any chance of them being tracked.[^106]  
  
Though, after nearly 5 years of being concealed in the bush of the woods, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had finally been found and she could finally be laid to rest.[^107]  
  
The authorities delicately recovered [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains, with [Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) ensuring to go the extra mile for the 13 year old girl.  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains were placed in a body bag, though the bag was left open by [Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) so that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) wouldn't be left in the dark anymore.[^108]  
  
[Detective Chad Moose](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Chad-Moose.md) even went as far as to place a stuffed animal in the body bag as her remains were transported back to Rowan County.  
  
He ensured that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) received the dignity and respect that she never got when she was alive.[^109]  
  
>[!quote]  
>"Erica got more love from the community than she ever did from her adoptive family."  
  
It had been clear to the investigators that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) had been the mastermind behind what had happened, and so they decided not to immediately tell [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) that they had found [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains - giving her one final chance to confess.[^110]  
  
(Phone call 2:02)  
  
[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s remains were received by the medical examiner on the 14th of October 2016, and the medical examiner spent 3 months studying every segment of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s skeleton.[^111]  
  
It was immediately clear that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had a sustained injuries prior to death, and horrifyingly a considerable amount of them.

[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s brother [James Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-James-Parsons.md) spoke about the horrors that he witnesses his parents inflict on [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md).

[Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) not only endued this physical abuse and violence, she was also starved.  
  
Food was withheld from [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) for long enough periods that it actually stunted her growth, with the length of her long bones being equivalent to that of a 9 year old.[^112]  
  
(me clip 7:33ish)  
  
You can feel the hatred that they had for [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) through the family photos that were taken.  
  
You can see [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s siblings happy, joyful, having a good time.  
  
But there in the background, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) is stood facing the corner.  
  
And this is captured in multiple family photos.  
  
The pain my heart feels when I see these images is simply unexplainable.  
  
I cannot begin for a second to even fathom the pain that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) had gone through - seeing her siblings be rewarded, be happy, while she was physically abused, starved, and made to stand in the corner.  
  
It's just not comprehendible.  
  
On the 18th of June 2017, [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) was finally laid to rest in a funeral paid for by the Rowan County community - it was attended by hundreds of people.  
  
The community ensuring that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) received the love she deserved.  
  
On the 20th of February 2018, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) were both charged with first degree murder, felony child abuse, felony concealment of death, and obstruction of justice in connection to [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s death.  
  
And on the 2nd of august 2019, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) pled guilty in Rowan County Superior Court to murder and child abuse in [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md)'s murder.  
  
When she finally confessed, she was described as being cold and callous.  
  
She admitted to the horrendous abuse, and showed no remorse.  
  
This is the statement that [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) gave to the court when she pled guilty.  
  
[Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md)  
  
[Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) also pled guilty to second degree murder and child abuse.  
  
Here's the statement that he made to the court.  
  
Bizarrely, [Sandy](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) had believed that he had made a deal with the FBI in order to reduce his sentence even though no such deal had been made.  
  
Whatever the case, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) remains behind bars in a prison in Tallahasse, Florida, serving 10 years for fraud and will begin a life sentence for murder this year in 2024.  
  
[Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) remains behind bars in Fairton, New Jersey, serving 8 years for fraud and 33 to 43 years for the murder of [Erica Lynn Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md), he will be eligible for parole at the age of 82.  
  
And through all of this, [Casey Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Casey-Parsons.md) and [Sandy Parsons](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Sandy-Parsons.md) remain married.  
  
And no clear motive has ever been established.  
  
It is of my view that they were two simply evil people who thought of [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) as less than an animal - something they could take their anger out on, torture, starve.  
  
We can only hope that [Erica](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Erica-Lynn-Parsons.md) is at peace now, with justice served, and that the state re-examine their policies and safeguards to ensure something like this never happens again.  
  
Usual outro.
