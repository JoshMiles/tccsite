Welcome to my research hub for all my true crime cases for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/itsjoshuamiles).

### Important to Note

- Most PDF files **won't** be uploaded to this hub as there is a 4GB limit, so I will try to link them in `PRO.22.01`.
	- You will be able to find the `PR0.22.01` Outline which has information about what's inside each PDF.
- The `P01 - Case of John Doe` folder contains an example research project demonstrating how it is setup. Reference the Case Structure table below for more information.
	- I follow the Johnny.Decimal system for organisation, see [here](https://johnnydecimal.com/).
- Any `00 Placeholder` files exist solely due to the fact that empty folders can't be published to the repo so they need a file inside. The `00 Placeholder` file is empty and serves no other use than to mitigate this limitation.

> [!NOTE]
> You are more than welcome to use my research in your own coverage of these cases, all I ask is that you provide credit and link back to this repo. Feel free to send me links to your coverage as I would love to see it!

### Case Structure

Briefly, the notation for folders follows `PRO.AC.ID` (where `PRO` is the project, `AC` is the area and category and `ID` is the unique identifier for the file). Where `ID` is referenced in notation, it simply means all files under that folder.

| Folder                                 | What is it                                                                                                                                    |
