On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], during the early morning hours, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|the defendant]] [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] (dob 1975/07/19) savagely beat, cut and ultimately drowned his estranged wife, [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] at her [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] home, located at [216 240th St SW, Bothell, WA](geo:47.78026465,-122.23629542497216).[^1] ^9pr8u

The attack was precipitated by a contentious dissolution and custody battle between [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. The attack has essentially orphaned [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s two young [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]], aged six and three. The attack appears to have been carefully planned out, with extensive efforts made at both obscuring who the killer was, and at leaving little [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/03 Forensic Evidence|forensic]] evidence for investigators to find.

The murder of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] initially came to the attention of law enforcement on the morning of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]] when a co-worker of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] called the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] Police Department and indicated that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had not come to work either [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]] or [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. According to the co-worker, efforts had been made at calling [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], with no success. The failure to either show up for work or two answer phone calls was described as highly unusual for [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^y-pur

[[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] officers arrived at [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home for a welfare check at approximately 11:30am. Officers knocked and got no response. The police then walked around the home and peered in windows. While looking in the window of a room subsequently identified as [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s bedroom, police saw significant amounts of blood on the floor and wall. This room had obviously been the scene of a violent struggle. ^3aiak

Police entered the home thru the unlocked front door. Inside the home, police discovered [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been murdered in a particularly brutal fashion. Based on the blood splatter evidence, it was apparent that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had initially been attacked while she was in her bed. The attack then moved to the floor between the bed and the wall. This area had extensive blood pooling, smearing and spattering. The blood splatter was consistent with a medium velocity bloodletting event i.e a beating with either fists or some type of blunt object. ^gx1b8

[[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was apparently rendered defenceless at this location, as bloody drag marks led from this location down the hall into a bathroom. During this portion of the struggle, [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s panties and Kotex (menstrual pad) were either removed by her assailant or came off during the fight. ^ve1sz

[[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was menstruating at the time of her murder, so it is unlikely she would have been sleeping without her panties and feminine hygiene product. ^yd897

Inside the bathroom, police discovered [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body inside the bathtub. The bathtub was full of water. [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was clothed only in a grey t-shirt, and was face down in the water. The bathwater was tepid, and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body temperature was consistent with her having been in the tub for several days. ^bqqpt

Police later determined it would take approximately 17 minutes to fill the tub to the point they found it in. Due to the injuries that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had sustained to her face, police were initially unable to positively identify her. ^r7a1m

The police requested the assistance of the Washing State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) in processing the death scene. During the processing of the home police discovered a number of footprints left in blood in various locations in the house. Some of these bloody footprints appeared to have been of a bare foot showing through a blood soaked sock, some of them appeared to be that of a shoed foot, a shoe that had a distinct pattern on the sole, and some of them appeared to be that of a foot wearing some sort of covering, as of yet unidentified, that left a distinct patterned impression in the blood. ^b1o5c

On the bathtub, police discovered several bloody transfer impressions with a very distinct pattern. It appeared these bloody transfer impressions in blood without any ridge detail, leading police to conclude that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s killer had been wearing gloves. No murder weapons were located at the death scene. It appeared that at least some preliminary efforts at cleaning had been attempted. ^jl4d-

Police located no signs of forced entry. There was no evidence that the home had been ransacked or searched. Various items (laptops, smart phones, TV's) that would commonly be stolen in a burglary were left untouched. It appeared that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been targeted. ^nekyb

The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office conducted an [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/01 Autopsy|autopsy]] on [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]]. At [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/01 Autopsy|autopsy]], the pathologist discovered [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had suffered multiple injuries to her head and face: 12 sharp force injuries and 10 blunt force injuries. The blunt force blows caused a skull fracture that would have caused [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death. However, it was apparent that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was still alive when placed in the bathtub, as the medical examiner discovered that [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had drowned while face down in the tub. Other than a number of defensive bruises on her forearms and hands, [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had no injuries other than the 22 blows and cuts to her head. **No evidence of sexual assault was found.** ^roict

Police soon learned that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s estranged husband, and that he worked at the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant in Everett. Two detectives drove to the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant to interview [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], arriving there at approximately 3pm on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. Police initially identified themselves, and indicated that they were investigating a "serious crime", and that police had found a dead body in his wife's home. ^yfaul

Police also advised [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] were safe. **[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] did not ask questions as to whose body had been found, nor did he offer any assistance to police.** ^2v-kp

According to the two detectives, **[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s reaction seemed rehearsed.** ^5bgkf

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] gave police a description of his activities the last few days.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated that he had returned from a business trip to Ireland on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013|2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013]] and picked up his two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] from [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] at approximately 2:30pm.

According to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], this was the last time he had seen [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^2de3j

According to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], he and the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] had watched movies at his [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] Sunday evening ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013|2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013]]), and that they had all slept there. ^xlz25

The following morning, [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] stated he had dropped the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] off at day-care, picking them up after work. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] spent Monday night, [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], at his [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] and on Tuesday morning ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]), he once again dropped them off at day-care. ^t8mx7

During the course of the interview, police noticed that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had an injury to his left hand - it appeared swollen. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated this injury occurred when his 3 year old boy accidentally hit him with a hatchet.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] ultimately ended the interview after being asked why he might harm [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], stating "*I think I had better talk to an attorney.*".

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was advised that [[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|Child Protective Services]] ([[../../70-79 People/75 Police and Detectives/08 CPS|CPS]]) would be taking custody of his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] until the investigation was concluded.

Police left the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant at approximately 4:30pm.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] reinitiated contact with police at approximately 6:30pm, and indicated that he would voluntarily allow police to search both his [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] and his [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]]. 

Police began a search of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had a [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|Garmin]] portable [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]]. ^78mqr

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] were purchased earlier that day as he planned to pain an accent wall at his [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]].

Police also found an unopened box of Playtex brand latex gloves and a new 5 gallon gas container. ^382hs

Police started the search of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] shortly after completing the search of the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]]. During the course of this search, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated he had purchased the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]] at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated he had lunch at Taco Bell. ^5e3bz

Police later confirmed that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] at Home Depot at 1:40pm on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. ^mbz17

Police contacted [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s family law attorney, and pulled the various legal filings in the divorce and custody proceedings. It became readily apparent that the court proceedings had turned acrimonious.

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had hired and fired two lawyers, and was on his third at the time of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death. 

The initial petition of Dissolution was filed [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2011-11-18 Friday November 18th 2011|2011-11-18 Friday November 18th 2011]]. On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012|2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]] largely adopted a proposed Temporary Parenting Plan submitted by [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. According to [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s attorney, [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]], after the hearing, [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had a disagreement about an issue and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] became angry and gave [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] a menacing stare. ^5p1e-

According to [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]], this "incredibly menacing stare" was something the like he had never seen in 15 years of practise. Attorney [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] was so concerned about this interaction between the two that he commented on it to both [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] and staff at his office.

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-12-13 Thursday December 13th 2012|2012-12-13 Thursday December 13th 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] filed paperwork claiming that he now believed [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] may be sexually assaulting the two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]]. These filings were part of a motion to reconsider a failure by [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]] to order a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) appointed to the case. ^h0zed

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-01-10 Thursday January 10th 2013|2013-01-10 Thursday January 10th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]] denied the motion. ^og0hu

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-01-11 Friday January 11th 2013|2013-01-11 Friday January 11th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] filed a Motion of Revision of [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]'s Ruling on the GAL. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also filed papers indicating that he was fearful of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] moving the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] to her native Germany. This hearing was held on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-01-25 Friday January 25th 2013|2013-01-25 Friday January 25th 2013]], in front of [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/03 Judge Fair|Judge Fair]] who found no merit to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s accusations, and again found for [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. According to [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]], after this hearing, [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been waiting alone in the hall when she was approached by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and called a "monster". ^3i2pk

Police also contacted an ex-girlfriend of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]]. [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] had been dating [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] from September 2012 ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-09 September 2012|2012-09 September 2012]]) until late November 2012 ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. According to [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] often "ranted and ranted" about [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move the two [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] to Germany. During one angry rant in October 2012 ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10 October 2012|2012-10 October 2012]]), [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] queried something to the effect: "how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing". Several days following this in another angry phone call [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] stated that he "just wanted her to be done with". [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] also related that in one conversation she had with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], she mentioned that a friend of hers from the military told her how one could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] replied that "you could do that with a rubber [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] too". [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] helped [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] move from an [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] in Seattle to an [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] in [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] in [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. During this move, [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] saw and packed a rubber headed [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]]. ^9h1wa

Police interviewed a number of co-workers of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] from [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]]. One of these co-workers had known [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] since [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2011-01 January 2011|2011-01 January 2011]], and worked fairly closely with him. This co-worker termed the last year [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s "descent into madness" as he obsessed about his divorce, his hatred for [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], and his fear of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] getting custody of the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] and moving to Germany with them. ^6un01

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] adamantly told this co-worker that he would not allow [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] to get custody, nor allow her to move to Germany with them. This co-worker began avoiding contact with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] as he did not want to hear him obsess about the divorce.

Two other co-workers, [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] and [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/01 Colin Warner|Colin Warner]], travelled to Ireland with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], leaving [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02-04 Monday February 4th 2013|2013-02-04 Monday February 4th 2013]] and returning [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013|2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013]]. According to [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] talked almost exclusively about his divorce during the trip. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] realised that the court hearings were not going in his favour and he was angry, blaming the court system as being rigged to favour women and to take all of his money from him. ^1xs5t

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was angry about [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] potentially gaining custody and moving to Germany. [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] described [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] as a "psychopath", "evil", and "pure evil".

A search warrant was served on [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s personal iPad, and Android cell phone.

In [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-12 December 2012|2012-12 December 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made internet searches on Google for "How realistic is CSI Miami", "Most realistic crime shows", "Forensic Files", "Where do people get fake passports", "How long does it take for [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]] test", "How much material is needed for [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]]", and Forensic [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/04 DNA|DNA]] FAQ's from Orchid Cellmark Laboratory. ^52zkv

A subsequent search of financial records indicated that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] ordered an entire season of Forensic Files in December from Netflix. ^zqo0f
During [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/03 Forensic Evidence|forensic]] searches of both [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s cell phone and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s cell phone, it was discovered that after being advised of the body found in [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] texted [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s phone "Hi Susie" at 10:23pm on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. ^3lb-p
A search of all electronic communication between [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] indicated this was a highly unusual text. ^pf60z
There was text history going back 14 months to 12/13/11, consisting of 127 text messages between [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. 
In none of these texts did [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] ever simply write "hi" - all of the texts revolved around discussions of their [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] or issues relating to them, or issues between [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. 
In none of the texts, other than one sent [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], did [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] address [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] as "Susie".

Several search warrants were served on [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s financial records. 

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]], two sets of [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]], and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot. ^adwpf

In the various searches of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] and [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]], police were never able to locate these items.

Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] were consistent with what was found at the death scene. ^1kt2m

According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.". ^rj7e9

Similarly, police purchased a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] identical to the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] purchased by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]] and requested a [[../../60-69 Evidence/62 Forensic/03 Forensic Evidence|forensic]] scientist compare the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]] to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/03 Mallet|mallet]]. ^7rrk7

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s financial records show that on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012|2012-11-24 Saturday November 24th 2012]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle. ^lor3j

This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], where he told them his last bike ([[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]]) was stolen from his Ravenna [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] sometime in [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10 October 2012|2012-10 October 2012]]. ^p1hcc

A check of surveillance video ([[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/01 CCTV|CCTV]]) on the route from [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] to [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home (1.7 miles each way) located a biker coming from the direction of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] at 2:24am in the early morning hours of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]]. The quality of the video is such that one can say little more than it is an individual on a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]]. A check of [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/01 CCTV|traffic cameras]] located a biker eastbound of 240th St. make a left hand turn (northbound) onto the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]]-Everett Highway at 4:13am. This would be the most direct route from [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home to [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]]. Once again, the quality is such that little can be said other than that it shows a person on a [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]]. ^nqxr-

The [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased in [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]], and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/03 Canyon Park QFC|Canyon Park QFC]] by an employee there. This is a store that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013|2013-02-10 Sunday February 10th 2013]] and [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]]. ^3qyh6

This witness estimates the date he first saw the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] as around [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013|2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013]]. This same witness later saw the same [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013|2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013]], but before [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013|2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013]]. ^szlna

The witness called police who came and collected the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]]. A check of the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]]'s serial number confirmed it was the same [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] as the one purchased by [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] in [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. ^b027t

The time frame that the various cameras ([[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/01 CCTV|CCTV]]) show a bicyclist on the route to and from [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/05 Apartment|apartment]] is consistent with the time frame police believe the murder occurred. Police believe [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] may have left his [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/01 Bicycle|bicycle]] unattended and unsecured in the hopes that it would be stolen, this disposing of it as possible evidence. ^ccr9m

Police also served a warrant on the [[01 Garmin GPS|Garmin GPS]] in [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]]. An analysis of the data from the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] device showed that on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] travelled to the area of the 23200 block of 2rd Ave. SE (location of Little Bears Day-care, where his [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] went) at 7:54am, and then travelled to the location of the Albertson's parking lot located at 12811 Beverly Park Rd., in Lynnwood, arriving at 8:10am, and not leaving until 8:20am. ^21cxg

The [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] located the [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] in the northwest side of the parking lot. Two large dumpsters are located at this location. Police theorize that this is where [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] may have disposed of various bloody items related to the murder of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^jzvs9

The [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] then indicated [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to work. According to the data from the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]], the stop at the Albertson's parking lot is not a normal stop for [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], and it is a stop he neglected to tell police about. ^kttvy

The following day, [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicated that, as [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] told police, he left [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant at approximately 1:15pm. The data indicates that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then drove to the 11300 block of Evergreen Way, Everett, arriving at 1:21pm, and leaving at 1:35pm. This is the location of the Everett Walmart. ^8obpg

Police were able to confirm that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] did in fact stop at Walmart via surveillance video ([[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/01 CCTV|CCTV]]) and receipts. ^buz6d

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a pair of [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/06 Croc-style Shoes|croc-style shoes]], two pairs of Playtex gloves, and a gas can with cash. ^qrmn9
This cash transaction is unusual as [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] usually uses a debit or credit card. ^kr3ud
The soles of the croc shoes visually matched some of the shoe prints left in blood at the death scene. ^deb7g

Police purchased an identical pair of shoes and asked the crime lab to compare the soles of the shoes to the impressions left in blood at the scene. ^x1gwk

The conclusion from the forensic scientist was that "the shoes can be included in the possible designs that correspond to this impression". ^btri5

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] neglected to tell police he stopped at Walmart. ^7xmwg

These [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/06 Croc-style Shoes|croc style shoes]] have not been recovery by police during any of their searches of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s home or [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]]. ^rcj3e

Following the purchase of the shoes, gloves, and gas can, the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicated that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to the 11915 Highway 99, the location of the Home Depot. ^v5fr9

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] admitted purchasing two [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] at Home Depot at this time. ^n0g3z

After [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s departure from Home Depot, the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that he drove to [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]], arriving at the intersection of 240th St SE and Meridian Ave South at 2:00pm. ^e046k

This intersection is several blocks from [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home. ^id37i

At the time [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s purpose was in going to the area of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], but it is known that at that time he had in his [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/04 Car|car]] two packages of [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/02 Kleenguard|coveralls]], a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [[../../60-69 Evidence/63 Physical/06 Croc-style Shoes|croc style shoes]]. ^0i0z8

After reaching the barricade, the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove back to work at [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]], arriving there at 2:47pm - 15 minutes before detectives arrived. ^9ks-l

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] neglected to tell police that he had gone to either Walmart or to the area of [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home. ^8s12y


The morning following the purchases at Walmart and Home Depot, [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]], the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data indicates that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left his home at 4:25am and headed south on I-405, exiting 405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on I-405. ^-3tvw

The [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] data shows that [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then continued back north on 405, ultimately ending his journey at the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant at 5:29am. His arrival at [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] was confirmed by [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]] security pass records. ^o0t7m

Shortly after his arrival at [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]], at 5:53am, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] began the internet searches for flights to South America as described above. ^xjbwn

During the day, [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] makes four separate cash withdrawals from an ATM at [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/01 Boeing|Boeing]]. ^pbpkf
The amount of these withdrawals is $1500. ^v8bwz
It is unknown why [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] drove to Renton in the early morning hours of [[../../10-19 Case Dates/12 Crime Dates/2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]] ^unn10
However, it is clear that this drive is unprecedented based on the data stored in the [[../../60-69 Evidence/61 Digital/02 Garmin GPS|GPS]]. ^w-cpy

Search warrants were also served on [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s person, specifically his feet, in a hope of determining whether or not they left the bloody footprints at the death scene.

The warrant allowed the taking of detailed photos of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s feet, the taking of inked impressions of his feet both standing and walking, and a video of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] walking.

These items were sent to Sgt. S.L Massey of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police (RCMP), Forensic Identification Services, along with photos of the various bloody footprints from. 

On [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013|2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013]], Sgt Massey completed her examination. ^t4971
Three of the bloody footprints were found to "support the proposition that this impression could have been made by the right foot of [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]", "Support" is a term of art that means based on the class characteristic details such as overall size, location of toe pads, overall widths of the heel and arch, the examiner would include this person as being the possible originator of the impression in question. Sgt Massey opined that there is a very low occurrence of a conclusion that someone "did make" a questioned foot impression, particularly when the foot in question was in some type of sock. ^0ilc9

The same day that Sgt Massey finished the foot morphology examination ([[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013|2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013]]), [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] contacted the [[../../50-59 Investigation/52 Key Locations/04 Bothell|Bothell]] Police.

[[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] said that he had met [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] at a potluck organised by some members of the church they both attend, City Church. ^nl96a
[[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] is an ordained minister, but does not hold a position of minister or pastor at City Church, nor is he employed or assigned as staff at City Church. [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]' role at City Church is that of a volunteer bible study group leader. ^82rjo

When [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] initially met [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], he was aware [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was a "person of interest" in his wife's murder. 
Due to the ongoing publicity surrounding the investigation into [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s murder, the staff at City Church told [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and his new girlfriend, [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/02 Love Thai|Love Thai]], they were no longer welcome to attend services at either the Seattle or Kirkland church campus. ^3unzj

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was told this either [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-22 Saturday June 22nd 2013|2013-06-22 Saturday June 22nd 2013]] or [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-23 Sunday June 23rd 2013|2013-06-23 Sunday June 23rd 2013]]. ^91dat
Being turned away from the City Church upset [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/02 Love Thai|Love Thai]]. ^w4n2t

They called [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/13 Investigation Dates/2013-06-23 Sunday June 23rd 2013|2013-06-23 Sunday June 23rd 2013]], asking to meet at Starbucks on south Lake Union. ^r0uzc
[[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] agreed. ^6edhg

While [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/02 Love Thai|Love Thai]] and [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]' wife spoke inside Starbucks, [[../../70-79 People/74 Witnesses/01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] and [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] spoke inside [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s vehicle. ^q5mvx

[[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] appeared distraught, stating that his life was in "chaos" and he felt "trapped in by tornadoes all around him", and that he was in over his head dealing with the mental issues of [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/02 Love Thai|Love Thai]]. ^iyl6w
