[[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] was [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s lawyer during her dissolution proceedings with [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]. After [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|Commissioner]] Brudvik had made her initial rulings on Temporary Orders related to the divorce on [[../../10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012|2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012]], the parties and their respective lawyers went out into the hall to reduce [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]'s rulings to writing. ^jhnjt

While this was going on, [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] disagreed on an issue relating to time with the [[../../70-79 People/73 Family and Friends/07 Children|children]] during the summer. According to attorney [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]], [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] got upset; and then fixed upon [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] what he described as an "incredibly angry" stare. [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] describes the stare as lasting approximately 5 seconds. [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] indicated in his written statement to police that the stare was something the like he had never seen in some 15 years of practise. The glare was concerning enough to [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]] that he asked [[../../70-79 People/71 Victim(s)/01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] about it, and mentioned it to his staff. ^zeg12

The State would ask the Court to deny [[../../70-79 People/72 Suspects and People of Interest/01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s motion to exclude this testimony from attorney [[../../70-79 People/77 Legal Teams/01 John Ely|John Ely]].
