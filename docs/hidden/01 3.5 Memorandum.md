At approximately 2:00pm, police Detectives [[./02 Steve Stone|Stone]] ([[./02 Detective Stone|Detective Stone]]) and Chissus ([[./01 Detective Chissus|Detective Chissus]]), and uniformed Office Caban left [[./04 Bothell|Bothell]] for the [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] plant. ^rqgn-  
En route, [[./02 Detective Stone|Detective Stone]] contacted [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] Security Officer Brian Ferguson and requested contact with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]. ^8-uzz

The purpose of the visit was both to inform [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that his wife appeared to have been murdered, that his [[./07 Children|children]] were safe, and to see whether [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] appeared to have any injuries that may have been associated with the murder, and to find out [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s whereabouts at relevant times. ^ubr5a

The three police officers arrived at [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] at approximately 2:45pm, and were escorted into a conference room by [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] security. ^lg8fx  
A short time later [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] Security escorted [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to the conference room. ^jisug

The conversation ended when [[./02 Detective Stone|Detective Stone]] suggested that the person who had committed the murder of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] must be feeling intense pain for their actions, and that person needed to know they could receive grace and mercy if that person was to turn themselves in and tell their side of the story. ^lb7ez
