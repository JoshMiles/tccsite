# 01 Bicycle

[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s financial records show that on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-24-Saturday-November-24th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-24-Saturday-November-24th-2012.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle.

This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md), where he told them his last bike ([bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md)) was stolen from his Ravenna [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Apartment.md) sometime in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-October-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-October-2012.md).

The [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012.md), and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [Canyon Park QFC](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Canyon-Park-QFC.md) by an employee there. This is a store that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md) and [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md).

This witness estimates the date he first saw the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) as around [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-21%20Thursday%20February%2021st%202013.md). This same witness later saw the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-21 Thursday February 21st 2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-21%20Thursday%20February%2021st%202013.md), but before [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-28 Thursday February 28th 2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-28%20Thursday%20February%2028th%202013.md).

The witness called police who came and collected the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md). A check of the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md)'s serial number confirmed it was the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01%20Bicycle.md) as the one purchased by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012.md).
