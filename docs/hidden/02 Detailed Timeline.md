- The trial court gave its oral decision to the parties, which included findings of fact and conclusions of law.[^388] 
- The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s involvement in the crime.[^389] 
- In particular, the court found that at the time of [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s death, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] obsessed with the dissolution, and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] frequently expressing his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members.[^390] 
- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] also expressed concern that [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] would take their two [[./07 Children|children]] back to her native Germany.[^391] 
- The trial court found that in the fall of 2012, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made statements to a woman he was involved with that he would like [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] to disappear, and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] asked the woman if she knew of anyway to "*get rid of*" someone.[^392] 
- At around the same time, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] and [[./02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]] - items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene.[^393] 
- The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [[./04 DNA|DNA]] match to [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on a washcloth located under [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]].[^394] 
- The trial court noted in its oral findings that in the early morning hours of [[./2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s house.[^395] 
- Evidence was also presented that a [[./01 Bicycle|bicycle]] that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had recently purchased was later found abandoned near [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s apartment complex.[^396] 
- The trial court also found that the [[./02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[./2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]] and [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]].[^397] 
- In particular, on the morning of [[./2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters.[^398] 
- On [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [[./02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]], masking tape, croc-style shoes with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police.[^399] 
- Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [[./07 Children|children]] on the morning of [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], and a modified search for flights for one adult after [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[./07 Children|children]] were placed with [[./08 CPS|Child Protective Services]].[^400]
- After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was guilty of the crime of murdering [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]], but that the evidence must be considered in light of [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s interactions with [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] to whom [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] confessed. [^401] 
- The trial court concluded that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s confession to [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]], in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was responsible for the murder of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]].[^402] 
- The Court convicted [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] of Murder in the First Degree after hearing the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict.[^403] 
- The sentencing hearing was scheduled for [[./2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015|2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015]] at **1:30pm**.[^404] 

### [[./2015-02-17 Tuesday February 17th 2015|2015-02-17 Tuesday February 17th 2015]]

- The State's sentencing memorandum was filed prior to the sentencing of [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]].[^405]
- This is what the State requested within the sentencing memorandum, they noted that:
	- Murder in the First Degree is a level XV offense.[^406] 
	- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had no prior criminal history, thus having an offender score of "0".[^407] 
	- The standard range sentence for [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was 240 to 320 months.[^408] 
	- The Court found that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had been armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the offense.[^409] 
		- This finding adds 24 months to both the top and the bottom of the standard range, for an actual standard range of 264 to 244 months.[^410] 
	- The Court also found that this was a crime of Domestic Violence.[^411] 
		- This offense also carries 36 months of community custody.[^412] 
	- The State's recommendation is that the Court sentence [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to the high end of the actual range, 344 months.[^413] 
	- In looking at the facts of this case it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence. [^414] 
	- This murder was no "heat of the moment" event. [^415] 
	- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] chose a time when [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] would least likely be able to defend herself, and when it was least likely that anyone would witness any part of the act and attempt to intervene.[^416] 
	- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] took multiple steps to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for police to find. [^417] 
	- Further, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] used his own [[./07 Children|children]] as props in his story to police, holding them forth as proof he did not venture out into the night and "*kill the mother of his [[./07 Children|children]]*".[^418] 
	- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s arrogance manifested itself in a belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned well enough he would be able to get away with murder. [^419] 
	- It would appear, from all the evidence in the case, that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] approached this vicious attack like he would have any problem at work; this is, with enough thought and engineering anything could be managed.[^420] 
	- The manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] planned the attack, and the manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body in the bathtub demonstrates this. [^421] 
	- [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] believed he had thought of everything - coming under the cover of darkness, wearing protective gear, disposing of the various items used in the attack, and having a story he believed could not be not be disproved. [^422] 
	- Ultimately, however, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was undone both by various items he did not account for, and by his own unravelling when his "post-Susann" life did not turn out as he anticipated.[^423] 
	- The degree to which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s selfishness will impact the lives of [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s family and his [[./07 Children|children]] is hard to overstate.[^424] 
	- In an effort to keep his [[./07 Children|children]] from going with their mother to her native Germany, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her [[./07 Children|children]] and church.[^425] 
	- Because he feared that the [[./07 Children|children]] might be moved to Germany at some point, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] has essentially orphaned them. [^426] 
	- The grotesque manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] treated [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in the bathtub, speaks volumes as to the disdain he had for anyone's desires or wishes other than his own.[^427] 
	- The horrific scene that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left in blood at the home where his [[./07 Children|children]] lived would seem clear evidence [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] thought of no one but himself.[^428] 
	- The cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] cannot be exaggerated. [^429] 
	- The Court saw the damage [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] inflicted on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], so it will not be belaboured here.[^430] 
	- However, the location of the injuries, the number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the placement of her in the bathtub once she was completely helpless demonstrates a single mindedness of purpose on [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s part. [^431] 
	- The pain and horror that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate.[^432] 
	- The State would request that the Court impose the high end of the actual standard range of 344 months.[^433] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions.[^434] 
	- The State would also ask the Court to order [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to have no contact with Kristine Hentschel, Johanna and Werner Hentschel (all three are members of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s family) for life.[^435] 
	- The State would also ask that the Court order no contact with either Noelani Smith and Felix Smith (the [[./07 Children|children]]) until they reach the age of 18, respectively.[^436]
