Police began a search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04%20Car.md) at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) had a [Garmin](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) portable [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02%20Garmin%20GPS.md) in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md).

Police started the search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Apartment.md) shortly after completing the search of the [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04%20Car.md). During the course of this search, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) indicated he had purchased the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) indicated he had lunch at Taco Bell.

On [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md), two sets of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) were consistent with what was found at the death scene.

According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.".

[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) admitted purchasing two [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) at Home Depot at this time.

At the time [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md)'s purpose was in going to the area of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s home on [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md), but it is known that at that time he had in his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04%20Car.md) two packages of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md), a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [croc style shoes](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/06%20Croc-style%20Shoes.md).
