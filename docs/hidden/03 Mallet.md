# 03 Mallet

Police also contacted an ex-girlfriend of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md), [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md). [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) had been dating [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) from September 2012 ([../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-09-September-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-09-September-2012.md)) until late November 2012 ([../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012.md). According to [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) often "ranted and ranted" about [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md), the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move the two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07%20Children.md) to Germany. During one angry rant in October 2012 ([2012-10-October-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-October-2012.md)), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) queried something to the effect: "how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing". Several days following this in another angry phone call [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) stated that he "just wanted her to be done with". [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) also related that in one conversation she had with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md), she mentioned that a friend of hers from the military told her how one could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) replied that "you could do that with a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) too". [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) helped [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) move from an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Apartment.md) in Seattle to an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Apartment.md) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-Bothell.md) in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-11-November-2012.md). During this move, [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04%20Rachel%20Amrine.md) saw and packed a rubber headed [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md).

On [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md), two sets of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02%20Kleenguard.md), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Similarly, police purchased a [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) identical to the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) purchased by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md) and requested a [forensic](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/03%20Forensic%20Evidence.md) scientist compare the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md). The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md) exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md).

The significance of [Dr Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md)' findings was, among other things, that two different weapons were used to kill [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md). ^hw10w  
[Dr Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) was shown a type of [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) that the police were able to document [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01%20Alan%20Smith.md) purchasing on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md). ^rk526  
[Dr Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04%20Dr%20Stanley%20Adams.md) opined that this type of weapon would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md).

[Kathy Geil](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/05%20Kathy%20Geil.md), forensic scientist at Washington State Police, also examined photographs of the injuries and the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md), and indicated the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03%20Mallet.md) was "consistent" with the wound patterns documented on [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/01%20Autopsy.md) photos. ^ca0gh  
It is also apparent from looking at the location of the various wounds on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01%20Susann%20Smith.md)'s body that the sole intent of her assailant was to kill her.
