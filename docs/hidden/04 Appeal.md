# Facts

On [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], wife of [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], did not show up for work. Her employer called the police, who went to her residence and found her lying face down in the bathtub. Her death was caused by multiple head injuries and asphyxia due to drowning. #[[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]] 

At the time of her death, [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had been separated from [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] for over a year and the two were in the midst of acrimonious dissolution proceedings.

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was frustrated and angry with the way the proceedings were going and was very concerned that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] would take the [[./07 Children|children]] away from him and return to her home country of Germany.

[[./2012 Fall 2012|2012 Fall 2012]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was involved with a woman named [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]]. He told [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] that he would like to just get rid of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] and asked if she knew of a way to make that happen without anyone knowing. In a joking manner, they discussed the possibility of using potassium chloride or a rubber [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] to kill someone. When [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] again mentioned his desire to have [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] disappear, however, [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] started to wonder if he was being serious. ^8jnlc

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] and a pair of [[./02 Kleenguard|disposable coveralls]] in [[./2012-10 October 2012|2012-10 October 2012]]. Forensic testing and analysis indicated that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s injuries were consistent with the type of [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased, but did not conclusively establish that her wounds were caused by that type of [[./03 Mallet|mallet]]. Fabric impressions found at the scene were also consistent with the impressions that would have been left by the [[./02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased. #Evidence ^ywtg2

[[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was found in the home she formerly shared with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]].

There were no signs of forced entry and the door was unlocked. Blood was found in the bedroom, the bathroom, and near the front door. There were bloody footwear impressions in the kitchen, the hallway, and leading to the front door. A hand towel found under the body contained [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[./04 DNA|DNA]]. #Evidence 

Based on surveillance footage and eyewitness accounts, there had been a man riding a bike near [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence early in the morning on [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. 

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had purchased a [[./01 Bicycle|bicycle]] from Gregg's Green Lake in [[./2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. ^3nz02

A few weeks after [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death, the bike was found abandoned in a ravine across from [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[./05 Apartment|apartment]] complex.

A global positioning system ([[./02 Garmin GPS|GPS]]) device found in [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s vehicle, provided data that allowed investigators to track [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s movements.  
The [[./04 Bothell|Bothell]] police observed that on [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] made some detours from his usual daily route from home to his [[./07 Children|children]]'s day care and then to his job at [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]]. That morning he stopped at some dumpsters in an Albertsons' parking lot after stopping at the day care center. Around 2:00 p.m., [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] and drove in the vicinity of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence. The road leading to her home was barricaded, however, by police who were investigating her death. [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then drove to a gas station and later returned to [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]].

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s internet search history for [[./2013-02 February 2013|2013-02 February 2013]] revealed searches for flights to Venezuela and Canada, initially for one adult and two [[./07 Children|children]]. After he was notified of his wife's death, however, he began to search for tickets for only one adult.

The investigation into [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s death continued for a number of months.

During that time, in [[./2013-06 June 2013|2013-06 June 2013]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] began dating a woman named [[./02 Love Thai|Love Thai]]. ^yg4k2  
[[./02 Love Thai|Love Thai]] and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] wanted to attend City Church's Belltown campus.  
They were told that because of their involvement in the homicide investigation they could not attend services at any of the City Church campuses or be part of the church's community groups.

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] met [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]], a City Church group leader at a church-sponsored event. Sometime after learning that she and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] could no longer attend services at City Church, [[./02 Love Thai|Love Thai]] contacted [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]'s wife. [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] (and his wife) decided to meet with [[./02 Love Thai|Love Thai]] and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to "minister the Word of God" to them.

[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] had been an associate minister at Eastside Baptist Church (Eastside Baptist). He left Eastside Baptist in 2010 and joined City Church, intending to "lessen [his] profile" and "shed the title of 'associate minister.'" . In his words, he wanted to become merely "a man of God among other men of God." After a year, [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] sought out additional opportunities with City Church and became a small group leader. [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] did not tell [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that he had previously been an associate minister at Eastside Baptist.

[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] testified that he had agreed to meet [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] at a coffee shop in South Lake Union.  
When [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] arrived, Thai approached him, told him that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was outside in his [[./04 Car|car]], and that he needed some support. ^34xg1  
[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] went to [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[./04 Car|car]] and saw that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was upset. ^q5sqa  
Morris [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that he had come "to point [him] to the Lord, [and] the Word of God." ^m3bea  
[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] began to speak with [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] about some of his recent struggles.

[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] told [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that he needed to know if [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was involved in the murder of his wife.  
[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] looked around and expressed concern about how "safe" the area was. ^ikhu2  
[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] told [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that whatever he said would stay between the two of them. ^nbz5d

The two decided to take a walk, and then [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] said 

> "[w]hat you asked me about in the [[./04 Car|car]], the answer is yes." 

When asked for clarification, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] stated, 

> '"I did it to her,'" 

and became emotional.

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] then looked at [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] and stated "I trust what you do with this information."  
[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] understood [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s comment to mean that he had [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s permission to take his statements to the authorities. ^7iv1s

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] continued their conversation and [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated that he would like to be baptized. ^evjfl  
[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] decided that they could go that day to the Citadel church in Des Moines, because it was open late. ^ttpeq  
When they arrived at the Citadel they discovered that the church did not have a baptistery. ^mz2we  
[[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] had mentioned earlier that he could possibly baptize [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and he agreed to do so at Alki beach in West Seattle. ^uqgcs

During the next few days, [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] contacted [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] by phone and text message to try to persuade him to speak with the authorities. ^3tul9  
When [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] declined to turn himself in, [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] called the police on [[./2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013|2013-06-25 Tuesday June 25th 2013]]. ^3kruz

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was charged with first degree murder with a deadly weapon, with the aggravating factor of domestic violence. ^lq-sd  
He moved to suppress evidence of his statements to [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]. At the suppression hearing, the court heard testimony from ministers from Eastside Baptist and City Church.

Pastor Arthur C. Banks, from Eastside Baptist Church, Tacoma, testified  
that an ordained minister for his church is one who has been examined by  
several churches within the denomination and has received a recommendation that he or she has met the spiritual qualifications to be ordained. If Eastside Baptist accepts the recommendation, then that person is ordained, and he or she can perform all of the functions of a pastor without supervision.

Pastor Banks further testified that [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] had become a licensed associate minister with Eastside Baptist. He explained the role of the licensed associate ministers and that they may only perform duties at Eastside Baptist under the supervision of the pastor. For example, a licensed associate minister would not be able to perform a baptism, communion, wedding, or funeral without being supervised by the pastor.

Pastor Banks confirmed that when [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] joined City Church, he became a member of that church and was no longer a member of Eastside Baptist. At that point neither Eastside Baptist nor Pastor Banks had any authority over [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]]. The pastor also testified that Eastside Baptist does not have an organized confession but asks its congregation to confess to God; on occasion when Pastor Banks counsels members, he tells them upfront that he reserves the right to notify the authorities if they have done anything harmful or illegal.

Pastor Jason Michalski from City Church testified that its policies require  
church staff to inform their members that any information they share may be disclosed to other staff members, and that the church reserves the right to report the content of a disclosure to the authorities. He also explained that City Church is "not a church that necessarily you need to go confess your sins to a pastor or a leader or anyone." VRP (4/14/14) at 140. Pastor Michalski also testified that the "City Groups" were small community groups of members that would meet outside of service to discuss particular topics or portions of scripture. Pastor Michalski confirmed that [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] served as a City Group leader, but testified that [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] was never a licensed or ordained minister at City Church.

The trial court found that [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] was not acting as a member of the clergy for Eastside Baptist when he spoke with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and that he did not have any authority from Eastside Baptist to counsel anyone or perform a baptism. The trial court also found that [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] never became a licensed or ordained minister with City Church and that he was not acting as a City Group leader when he spoke with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]. While it was undisputed that Morris told [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that their conversation would stay between the two of them, the trial court determined that the communication was not confidential because [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] was acting in his individual capacity. The trial court also found [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s statement — "I respect what you do with this information" — led [[./01 Wendell Morris|Wendell Morris]] to believe that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] understood that he would go to the civil authorities with the information. Based on these findings, the trial court concluded that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had not sustained his burden of showing that his statements were protected by clergy-penitent privilege.

At trial, the State presented photographs of bloody footwear impressions  
found in the kitchen and bathroom of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s residence. Sgt. Shelly Massey, a forensic identification specialist for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, compared these photographs to inked impressions of [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s feet (bare and wearing socks). Sgt. Massey testified that based on the impression left at the scene, she was "unable to exclude and in fact... would include Mr. Smith as a possible source of who could have made this particular impression." [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] moved the court for a Frye hearing to determine the admissibility of Sgt. Massey's testimony, arguing that the use of barefoot morphology evidence is not generally accepted in the scientific community. The trial court denied the motion because Sgt. Massey made a physical comparison of the prints and could not state an opinion more definite than that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was a "'possible' maker of the footprints."

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was found guilty and sentenced to 344 months. 

Prior to sentencing, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] moved for new counsel, arguing that he had received deficient representation and that he and his attorney had an irreconcilable conflict. The trial court found that any conflict between [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and counsel arose from differences of opinion with regard to trial tactics, and that his complaints did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. He appeals.
