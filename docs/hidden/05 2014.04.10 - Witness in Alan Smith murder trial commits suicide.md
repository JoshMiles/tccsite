[Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#) and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#)

The girlfriend of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#), the [Bothell](./04%20Bothell.md#) man accused of killing his estranged wife early last year, died [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2014-04-08 Monday April 8th 2014](./2014-04-08%20Monday%20April%208th%202014.md#) in [Seattle](geo:47.6038321,-122.330062). ^1lccy

According to the King County Medical Examiner's Office, [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#) committed suicide.  
Marks around her neck indicate she died from a rope or something around her neck. ^oongz

Thai lived at Pacific Court in [Tukwila](geo:47.4627356,-122.2559156). The [apartment](./05%20Apartment.md#) manager could not confirm if [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#) had died in her home.

[Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#) told the _Reporter_ in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-07 July 2013](./2013-07%20July%202013.md#) she was pregnant with [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s child and there was an ultrasound photo posted to her personal Facebook account around the same time. ^4148p  
The medical examiner's office could not confirm if [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was still pregnant at the time of her death. ^taqjm

Lawyers for [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked a judge to push back his murder trial this week so they could have more time to prepare.  
[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s trial date was moved from [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2014-05-02 Friday May 2nd 2014](./2014-05-02%20Friday%20May%202nd%202014.md#) to [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2014-06-13 Friday June 13th 2014](./2014-06-13%20Friday%20June%2013th%202014.md#), according to Craig Matheson, senior deputy prosecuting attorney at Snohomish County Prosectors Office. ^hb6x1

"While certainly tragic, I don't think [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s death will affect the trial at all," Matheson said.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), who plead not guilty in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-07 July 2013](./2013-07%20July%202013.md#.md#), [is accused of killing his estranged wife](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/194405941.html) last February and sits in the Snohomish County Jail on $1 million bail. [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) is accused of murdering his wife [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#), who was found on[2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#), face down, beaten and drown to death in the bathtub of her [Bothell](./04%20Bothell.md#.md#) home while her two [kids](./07%20Children.md#) were away, according to court documents. She had defensive wounds on her hands and arms, a fractured skull, and 19 separate blunt force strikes, according to court documents. She had to be identified by her dental records.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) [moved back into the home](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/204131081.html) with [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-04 April 2013](./2013-04%20April%202013.md#) and had hopes of regaining custody of his two young [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#), who had been taken by Washington State [Child Protective Services](./08%20CPS.md#). ^qdarf

[Alan Smith and Thai seemed to have a rocky relationship](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/208901791.html) as police were called to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home for various incidents during May 2013, including a report of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) having sex in the front yard and for a domestic disturbance.

[When Alan Smith was charged](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/213571071.html)[../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-06-28 Friday June 28th 2013](./2013-06-28%20Friday%20June%2028th%202013.md#), he said his life was in "chaos." He stated that he was over his head "with [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and her mental issues," according to charging documents. ^9wx16

When [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) appeared in court [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-09-23 Monday September 23rd 2013](./2013-09-23%20Monday%20September%2023rd%202013.md#) on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction, [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), was there to defend him. ^bt6bq  
At the time, the two lived together in the home where [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#) was killed.

"I feel absolutely safe — absolutely. We argue, we throw things, but we don't hurt each other," [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said at the time.

She also believed that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was capable of killing.

"I don't know what his threshold is," she said. "Is the possibility and the capability there? Yes."

But she said she was in love and trusted [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#) completely.

"He said he did not do it," [Love Thai](./02%20Love%20Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said. "So, I stand by him and the truth will always set people free."

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#) and his attorney could not be reached for comment.
