[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#) was serving his #sentence at Coyote Ridge Corrections Centre in [Connel, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connell,_Washington) in 2022.

#Evidence presented at trial established that the man riding the [bicycle](./01%20Bicycle.md#) had been observed on the morning of [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#), not [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#).

#Evidence presented established that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#) stopped in the Albertson's parking lot near some dumpsters on the morning of [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#.md#), not [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#).

On [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2017-01-09 Monday January 9th 2017](./2017-01-09%20Monday%20January%209th%202017.md#), the Court of Appeals issued an unpublished opinion that affirmed [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s conviction following his #appeal. ^14w94

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed a pro se petition for review with the Washington #Supreme Court, which was denied for review without comment on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2017-08-02 Wednesday August 2nd 2017](./2017-08-02%20Wednesday%20August%202nd%202017.md#). ^25nj5

The Washington Court of Appeals issued its mandate terminating direct review on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2017-08-11 Friday August 11th 2017](./2017-08-11%20Friday%20August%2011th%202017.md#). ^vkc0d

On [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2016-06-12 Monday June 13th 2016](./2016-06-12%20Monday%20June%2013th%202016.md#), while his direct appeal was pending, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Washington #Supreme Court.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) waived his right to a jury trial, the verdict in his case rendered by the trial court itself. ^dc0d1

The trial court gave its oral decision to the parties on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2015-02-04 Wednesday February 4th 2015](./2015-02-04%20Wednesday%20February%204th%202015.md#), which included detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. ^3fp2r

The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s involvement in the crime. ^56wi2

In particular, the court found that at the time of [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#)'s death in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2013-02-February-2013](./2013-02%20February%202013.md#), [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#) were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) obsessed with the dissolution, and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) frequently expressed his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members. ^mb3r6

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also expressed concern that [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#) would take their two [children](./07%20Children.md#) back to her native Germany. ^rjc9s

The trial court found that in the [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-Fall-2012](./2012%20Fall%202012.md#), [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made statements to a women he was involved with that he would like [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#) to disappear, and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked the woman if she knew of anyway to "get rid of" someone. ^nlvp7

At around the same time, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a rubber [mallet](./03%20Mallet.md#) and [disposable coveralls](./02%20Kleenguard.md#), items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene. ^n-818

The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [DNA](./04%20DNA.md#) match to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on a washcloth located under [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^3crj0

And, in its oral findings, the trial court noted that, in the early morning hours of [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#.md#.md#), a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home. ^pcl2v  
Evidence was also presented that a [bicycle](./01%20Bicycle.md#.md#) that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had recently purchased was later found abandoned in a ravine near [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](./05%20Apartment.md#) complex. ^dq6od

The trial court also found that [GPS](./02%20Garmin%20GPS.md#) evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#). ^6jn7m

In particular, on the morning of [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters. ^zzzgl

On [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [disposable coveralls](./02%20Kleenguard.md#.md#), masking tape, [croc-style shoes](./06%20Croc-style%20Shoes.md#) with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police. ^f5n1i

Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [children](./07%20Children.md#) on the morning of [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and a modified search for flights for one adult after [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#) were placed with [Child Protective Services](./08%20CPS.md#). ^csezh

After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was guilty of the crime of murdering [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), but that the evidence must be considered in light of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s interactions with [Wendell Morris](./01%20Wendell%20Morris.md#) to whom [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) confessed. ^dnko1

The trial court concluded that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s confession to [Wendell Morris](./01%20Wendell%20Morris.md#.md#), in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was responsible for the murder of [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^0xg6r

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) argued that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But following a conviction, the evidence is viewed in a light most favourable to the State, with all reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence viewed in a manner supporting the prosecution.

Here, the evidence showed that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had expressed a desire to get rid of the victim because of acrimonious divorce, he had purchased items consistent with the murder weapon and evidence found at the scene, a man was seen riding a bike near the scene of the murder and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bike was later located nearby, and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made internet searches for flights to Venezuela after he was notified of the death.

Viewed in the light most favourable to the prosecution, taken together and drawing all inferences in favour of the State, this evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#) argued against the various aspects of his confession to [Wendell Morris](./01%20Wendell%20Morris.md#.md#.md#) and whether the confession was properly admitted into evidence at trial.

In particular, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#) asserts that the police acted improperly in obtaining the confession, and that the confession was improperly admitted into evidence without a determination of voluntariness.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#) also asserts that admission of the confession violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause and other unspecified state rules of evidence.

The Court observes that prior to trial, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) south to have his statements to [Wendell Morris](./01%20Wendell%20Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#) suppressed only on the grounds that the statements were protected from disclosure by the clergy-penitent privilege. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing after which it concluded that the asserted privilege did not apply.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) argued on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the statements, but the Court of Appeals rejected that argument.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also offered a myriad of other arguments as to why his statements to [Wendell Morris](./01%20Wendell%20Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) should not have been admitted, including those identified here in the context of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s sufficiency of the evidence claim, and the state courts consistently rejected those arguments.

In addition to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s challenges to the admissibility of his confession, he also takes issue with two statements in the Supreme Court [Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#)'s decision that he claims are erroneous.

The statements at issue did not appear in the discussion of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s sufficiency of the evidence claim but, instead, appeared in the portion of [the Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#.md#)'s ruling setting forth the underlying facts relevant to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s asserted claims.

The first challenged statement is:

> "Witnesses reported seeing a man riding a [bicycle](./01%20Bicycle.md#.md#.md#) near [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home in the early morning on the day she was murdered."

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) suggests that this statement is erroneous because it is inconsistent with the defence theory as to when [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was murdered. The statement, however, is consistent with the State's theory of when the crime occurred and, as noted above, the Court views all evidence in the light most favourable to the State in conducting its sufficiency review. 

**The fact that the statement was inconsistent with the defence theory is therefore irrelevant.**

The second challenged statement is:

> "Data retrieved from a [GPS](./02%20Garmin%20GPS.md#.md#) device in [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [car](./04%20Car.md#) revealed that on the day [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body was discovered, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had stopped by some dumpsters in a grocery store parking lot after dropping the [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#) off at school."

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) contends that the [GPS](./02%20Garmin%20GPS.md#.md#.md#) data showed he stopped in a grocery store parking lot but did not show him near the dumpsters.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also contends that the evidence showed the stop in the grocery store parking lot occurred on [2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](./2013-02-11%20Monday%20February%2011th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and not [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). However, this inaccuracy does not undermine [the Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#.md#.md#)'s conclusion with respect to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s sufficiency of the evidence claim.

With respect to [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s claim that the evidence did not show he stopped near the dumpsters, the Court again notes that [the Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#.md#.md#.md#) did not reference this fact in disposing of the claim.

Ultimately, none of [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s arguments demonstrate that the Washington Supreme Court [Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s resolution of his sufficiency of the evidence claim is contract to, or constitutes an unreasonable application of, United States Supreme Court law.

[Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) claims that police initiated the seizure and detention of his [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) several months prior to his arrest in order to coerce [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s cooperation in their investigation and obtain an incriminating statement.

The Washington Court of Appeals considered and rejected [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s challenge to the admissibility of his statements to law enforcement in [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s personal restraint proceedings. 

The Court of Appeals explained its conclusion as follows:

> [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) next contends that his confession to law enforcement should have been inadmissible because it was obtained through coercion. He contends that he cooperated with law enforcement investigation because detectives told him that his [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were in [Child Protective Services](./08%20CPS.md#) ([CPS](./08%20CPS.md#.md#)) custody and that "[a] reasonable person would not consider himself free to ignore police requests for information under the circumstances."

> [Detectives](./03%20Detectives.md#) drove to [Boeing](./01%20Boeing.md#) to talk with [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the date of [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s death. They interviewed [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) for approximately 25-30 minutes until one of them asked [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) if he had any reason to harm his wife and [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) requested an attorney. The detectives ceased questioning him and told him he was free to leave.

> [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#) went back to his office and one of the [Detectives](./03%20Detectives.md#.md#) called his commander, who stated that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#) were being placed in [CPS](./08%20CPS.md#) custody. The detectives then informed [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that [CPS](./08%20CPS.md#.md#) was taking custody of his [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and he could obtain the [CPS](./08%20CPS.md#.md#.md#) paperwork at the [Bothell](./04%20Bothell.md#) Police Department.

> [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#) drove to the police department. En route, he called the [Detectives](./03%20Detectives.md#) phone and authorized a search of his [car](./04%20Car.md#.md#) and [apartment](./05%20Apartment.md#.md#), and offered to voluntarily give a [DNA](./04%20DNA.md#.md#) sample. The searches took place that evening.

A detective told [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#) that [CPS](./08%20CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#) would retain the [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) until [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was cleared in the murder investigation.

> Following a CrR 3.5 hearing, the trial court found that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was not in custody on [2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](./2013-02-12%20Tuesday%20February%2012th%202013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-16 Saturday February 16th 2013](./2013-02-16%20Saturday%20February%2016th%202013.md#.md#) or [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2013-02-22 Friday February 22nd 2013](./2013-02-22%20Friday%20February%2022nd%202013.md#.md#) because a reasonable person in [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s position would not have believed he was in custody.

> Hence, there is nothing in the record indicating that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#)'s free will was overcome by the fact that his [children](./07%20Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were in [CPS](./08%20CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) custody. On several occasions, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) felt free to terminate questioning by [Detectives](./03%20Detectives.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and indeed did so. There was substantial evidence that [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s statements to detectives were voluntary.
