[John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#) was [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#)'s lawyer during her dissolution proceedings with [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#). After [Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#) Brudvik had made her initial rulings on Temporary Orders related to the divorce on [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2012-08-03-Friday-August-3rd-2012](./2012-08-03%20Friday%20August%203rd%202012.md#), the parties and their respective lawyers went out into the hall to reduce [the Commissioner](./02%20Commissioner.md#)'s rulings to writing. ^jhnjt

While this was going on, [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#) disagreed on an issue relating to time with the [children](./07%20Children.md#) during the summer. According to attorney [John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#), [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#.md#) got upset; and then fixed upon [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#) what he described as an "incredibly angry" stare. [John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#) describes the stare as lasting approximately 5 seconds. [John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#) indicated in his written statement to police that the stare was something the like he had never seen in some 15 years of practise. The glare was concerning enough to [John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#.md#) that he asked [Susann Smith](./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#.md#) about it, and mentioned it to his staff. ^zeg12

The State would ask the Court to deny [Alan Smith](./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#)'s motion to exclude this testimony from attorney [John Ely](./01%20John%20Ely.md#.md#.md#).
