Welcome to my research hub for all my true crime cases for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/itsjoshuamiles).

### Important to Note

- The `P01-Case-of-John-Doe` folder contains an example research project demonstrating how it is setup. Reference the Case Structure table below for more information.
	- I follow the Johnny.Decimal system for organisation, see [here](https://johnnydecimal.com/).

> [!NOTE]  
> You are more than welcome to use my research in your own coverage of these cases, all I ask is that you provide credit and link back to this repo. Feel free to send me links to your coverage as I would love to see it!
