# 01 CCTV

A check of surveillance video ([[01 CCTV|CCTV]]) on the route from [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[05 Apartment|apartment]] to [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home (1.7 miles each way) located a biker coming from the direction of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[05 Apartment|apartment]] at 2:24am in the early morning hours of [[2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013|2013-02-11 Monday February 11th 2013]]. The quality of the video is such that one can say little more than it is an individual on a [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]]. A check of [[01 CCTV|traffic cameras]] located a biker eastbound of 240th St. make a left hand turn (northbound) onto the [[04 Bothell|Bothell]]-Everett Highway at 4:13am. This would be the most direct route from [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home to [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[05 Apartment|apartment]]. Once again, the quality is such that little can be said other than that it shows a person on a [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]].

The time frame that the various cameras ([[01 CCTV|CCTV]]) show a bicyclist on the route to and from [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s [[05 Apartment|apartment]] is consistent with the time frame police believe the murder occurred. Police believe [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] may have left his [[01 Bicycle|bicycle]] unattended and unsecured in the hopes that it would be stolen, this disposing of it as possible evidence.

Police were able to confirm that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] did in fact stop at Walmart via surveillance video ([[01 CCTV|CCTV]]) and receipts.
