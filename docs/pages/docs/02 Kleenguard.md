Police began a search of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[04 Car|car]] at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] had a [[02 Garmin GPS|Garmin]] portable [[02 Garmin GPS|GPS]] in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]].

Police started the search of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s [[05 Apartment|apartment]] shortly after completing the search of the [[04 Car|car]]. During the course of this search, [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] indicated he had purchased the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]] at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett.

On [[2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[03 Mallet|mallet]], two sets of [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]], and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] [[02 Kleenguard|coveralls]] were consistent with what was found at the death scene.

According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.".
