# 03 Mallet

Police also contacted an ex-girlfriend of [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]]. [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] had been dating [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] from September 2012 ([[2012-09 September 2012|2012-09 September 2012]]) until late November 2012 ([[2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. According to [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] often "ranted and ranted" about [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move the two [[07 Children|children]] to Germany. During one angry rant in October 2012 ([[Cases/P02 Case of Susann Smith/10-19 Case Dates/11 Background Dates/2012-10 October 2012|2012-10 October 2012]]), [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] queried something to the effect: "how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing". Several days following this in another angry phone call [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] stated that he "just wanted her to be done with". [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] also related that in one conversation she had with [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]], she mentioned that a friend of hers from the military told her how one could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising. [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] replied that "you could do that with a rubber [[03 Mallet|mallet]] too". [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] helped [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] move from an [[05 Apartment|apartment]] in Seattle to an [[05 Apartment|apartment]] in [[04 Bothell|Bothell]] in [[2012-11 November 2012|2012-11 November 2012]]. During this move, [[04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] saw and packed a rubber headed [[03 Mallet|mallet]].

On [[2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]], [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchased a rubber [[03 Mallet|mallet]], two sets of [[02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]], and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.

Similarly, police purchased a [[03 Mallet|mallet]] identical to the [[03 Mallet|mallet]] purchased by [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on [[2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]] and requested a [[03 Forensic Evidence|forensic]] scientist compare the [[03 Mallet|mallet]] to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [[03 Mallet|mallet]].

The significance of [[04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]]' findings was, among other things, that two different weapons were used to kill [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^hw10w  
[[04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] was shown a type of [[03 Mallet|mallet]] that the police were able to document [[01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchasing on [[2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]]. ^rk526  
[[04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] opined that this type of weapon would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]].

[[05 Kathy Geil|Kathy Geil]], forensic scientist at Washington State Police, also examined photographs of the injuries and the [[03 Mallet|mallet]], and indicated the [[03 Mallet|mallet]] was "consistent" with the wound patterns documented on [[01 Autopsy|autopsy]] photos. ^ca0gh  
It is also apparent from looking at the location of the various wounds on [[01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body that the sole intent of her assailant was to kill her.
