On [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], [Bothell](geo:47.7623204,-122.2054035) Police Officers were dispatched to[216 240th St. SW, Bothell](geo:47.78026465,-122.23629542497216) for a welfare check of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] who had failed to report to work for the past two days. [^1] ^etnen

The first officer on scene was able to see through a window what appeared to be large amounts of blood on the floor of a bedroom and what appeared to be blood smears and splatter on the walls and window of the room. The officer also saw an apparent blood trial consistent with a blood body being dragged. ^4fugx

Officers entered the home to check on the welfare of those inside and found that there was no sign of forced entry. The officers observed bloody footprints in the kitchen and the hallway that ran the length of the left half of the residence. The footprints appeared to be from a single individual. Officers noticed that the amount of suspected blood increased considerably as the hallway stretched into the threshold of the bedroom that the responding officer had observed from outside the home. [^1] ^4bu4n

Officers found partially clothed female in the bathtub with her head submerged face down in the water. there were no signs of life on the victim who was later identified as [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] through the use of dental records. [^1] ^gm-rk

An [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]] was performed by Associate Medical Examiner S. Adams, MD. Dr. [^1] ^1fr93

Adams advised that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] suffered both blunt force and sharp force trauma to her face, forehead, and back of her head. She suffered a fractured skull to the lower left section. The Dr. estimated 19 separate blunt force and sharp force wounds on the face and head. [^1] ^6sb3y

[[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was observed to have contusions to both of her arms and hands that were consistent with defensive wounds. There were no sharp force wounds to any other parts of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body besides her face and head. There were no injuries to the torso and legs. The [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]] revealed the victim had water in her lungs and airway consistent with drowning. [^1] ^dus0l

**Dr. Adams determined the cause of death was blunt force and sharp force trauma with a third component of asphyxiation by drowning.** [^1] ^xyq2l

The blood evidence in the bedroom indicated that the assault started while the victim was in bed before graduating to the right side of the bed and then the floor. The blood evidence further indicated that there were breaks in the assault and then the assault continued on the same victim. The blood pattern and blood smearing on the floor made it evident that the victim was moved in a dragging fashion out of the bedroom into the hallway and into the bathroom. There was evidence that there had been an attempt to wipe up the blood in the room, hallway and the bedroom.[^1] ^bt-j2

There were observed several bloody finger type impressions throughout the house which did not show ridge detail. This was an indication that the suspect may have been wearing protective gloves during the commission of the crime. [^1] ^2rao0

Officers were able to determine that the suspect victim, [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] was married but currently separated from her husband [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]]. It was determined that [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] resided in Canyon Pointe Apartments, [[04 Bothell|Bothell]] ([1630 228th St SE, Bothell, WA 98021, United States](geo:47.789898,-122.2107043)), which is approximately ten minutes away from [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]](./04%20Bothell.md#)(./04%20Bothell.md#)(./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#)(./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#)(./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#)'s home when traveling by vehicle.[^1] 

Officers made contact with [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] at his place of employment, the [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] Aerospace Company in [Everett](geo:47.9793437,-122.2127011).[^1] ^9188d

When officers made contact with [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]], they observed his demeanour and movements to appear rehearsed. Officers at this time observed [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] to have a recent injury to his left hand that was swollen and the skin on top of his hand was flushed. [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] indicated that this injury was the result of his three year old son striking his hand with a hatched while cutting fire wood. A cut was also observed on [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s left thumb which he attributed to an injury from cutting an apple.[^1] ^t2yc8

[[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] re-contacted the [[./03 Detectives|Detectives]] at the [[./04%20Bothell.md#|Bothell]] Police Department at approximately 18:30 hours and agreed to a search of his vehicle. During the search, officers observed a [[./02 Garmin GPS|Garmin GPS]] portable [[./02 Garmin GPS|Garmin GPS]] in the front dash of his vehicle. Officers also observed a plastic Home Depot bag in the rear of the vehicle with two, unopened bags containing [[./02 Kleenguard|Kleenguard]] Chemical Splash Resistant [[./02 Kleenguard|Coveralls]], a new roll of masking tape and a pair of latex gloves still in their box.[^1] ^qyark

Detectives spoke with [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]], who advised that she was an ex-girlfriend of [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] and that the two had a 2-3 month dating relationship during the fall of 2012 (September 2012 until late November 2012[^2]). [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] advised that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] told her he was divorced and was currently going through a nasty, bitter custody battle with [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]. On more than one occasion, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] asked [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] how he could make someone disappear without anyone knowing. During one rant about [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] told [[./04 Rachel Amrine|Rachel Amrine]] that "*I just want her to be done with.*" ^1

[[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] and [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] were engaged in a contentious custody dispute over their two [[./07 Children|children]] following the filing of a Petition of Dissolution by [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] on 2011/11/18 [[./2011-11-18 Friday November 18th 2011|2011-11-18 Friday November 18th 2011]]. During the litigation [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went through three different lawyers. [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] was represented by [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] who described to law enforcement "an incredibly menacing stare" that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] gave to [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] after one ruling in which monthly support and maintenance were set by [[./02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]. [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] had previously indicated to [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] could be emotionally threatening and aggressive towards her. ^1

Beginning in November of 2012, [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] for the first time indicated that he had concerns about [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s parenting and made claims of sexual abuse by [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] which [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] described as "outrageous". The motions for reconsideration were denied and [[./02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]] awarded [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] $500 in attorney fees for having to respond to the motion to appoint a GAL. Subsequent to this ruling on 2013/1/10, [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] sent an email to [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] indicating that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was making up stories about [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] in his declaration in order to win in court. On 2013/1/11 [[./2013-01-11 Friday January 11th 2013|2013-01-11 Friday January 11th 2013]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] added to his motion for Revision a concern that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] was going to move back to Germany. After the 3rd hearing for Revision on 2013/1/25 [[./2013-01-25 Friday January 25th 2013|2013-01-25 Friday January 25th 2013]], at which [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] prevailed, [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] related to her attorney [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] confronted her and called her a "monster". ^1

Investigators spoke with two of [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]]'s co-workers who both described [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s preoccupation with his divorce proceedings. Co-worker [[./01 Colin Warner|Colin Warner]] told investigators about a work trip to Ireland that he, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[./03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] were on from 2013/2/6 - 2013/2/9 ([[./2013-02-06 Wednesday February 6th 2013|2013-02-06 Wednesday February 6th 2013]] to [[./2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013|2013-02-09 Saturday February 9th 2013]]) during which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] would change the topic to his family problems at least 60-70% of the time. [[./01 Colin Warner|Colin Warner]] indicated that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was very upset and distraught about his wife winning a recent court ruling regarding their [[./07 Children|children]] and commented *"I want her to know the pain I feel."* [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] implied that he thought his wife would move to Germany after getting full custody of the [[./07 Children|children]] and mentioned that she was mentally abusive to him and used to treat their dog poorly. ^1

Co-worker [[./03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] described the same trip to Ireland in which he was told by [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] several times that his wife was *"pure evil"* and called her a "*psychopath*". [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] told [[./03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] that his wife was interested in taking the [[./07 Children|children]] back to Germany. During this trip [[./03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] said that 70-80% of their conversations related to his divorce and ex-wife and became tiresome to hear. [[./03 Matthew Pierce|Matthew Pierce]] indicated that in the 2-3 years he had known [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] that the majority of their conversations were about [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s divorce and his wife. [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] communicated to him that the courts were against him and it was a "*fixed system*". ^1

Investigators were aware of searches made by [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] on his [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] computers which were provided to them by [[./01 Boeing|Boeing]] security. ^gltks  
These searches include a 0849hrs search on [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]] 2013/2/12 prior to notification of [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s death an inquiry on Kayak.com for flight information from Seattle to Venezuela for 1 adult and two [[./07 Children|children]] ages 6 and 3. ^87fl2  
At 0927hrs, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] performed a Google search for "Where is the best place to live in South Central America?". ^4zc93  
At 0931hrs, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] performed a Google search for, "Best Countries to Live and Work Abroad". ^1

After notification from law enforcement of [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s death and that his [[./07 Children|children]] had been placed in to [[./08 CPS|CPS]] custody, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] performed another search on Kayak.com.  
At 0606hrs on [[./2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013|2013-02-13 Wednesday February 13th 2013]] 2013/2/13, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] searched for flight information from Seattle to Venezuela for only 1 adult. ^1

Forensic analysis of [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]]'s cell phone showed that the last incoming text message from [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] was on [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]] 2013/2/12 which read "hi Susi". The detectives indicated that on no other occasion in the text message history did [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] refer to [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] as 'Susi', but specifically addressed her as 'Susann' on many of the messages. ^1

The Detective reported that in all time frames the conversation between [[./01%20Alan%20Smith.md#|Alan Smith]] and [[./01%20Susann%20Smith.md#|Susann Smith]] by text were with regards to child transfers or other issues with the [[./07 Children|children]] or them, and that in no other message did [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] ever simply write "hi". ^1
