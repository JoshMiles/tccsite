## Homicide Scene and Autopsy Photos

Police located the body of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] at approximately 10:30am on the [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], in the bathtub of her home in [[./04 Bothell|Bothell]].

During their initial sweep of the home, the responding officers took several hurried photographs of the scene, then backed out and awaited a search warrant.

The Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) from the Washington State Patrol arrived to serve the warrant at approximately 8:00pm the evening of [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]], and worked through the next several days in processing the death scene. ^i2hin

The assault on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] started in her bedroom. ^eepxu  
She was bludgeoned on her bed, the floor, and then dragged to the bathroom and placed in the bathtub. ^ysxff  
[[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] ultimately drowned in the tub. ^akjbg

The blood splatter in the bedroom, hallway, and bathroom was extensive. ^ji1yh  
Throughout the blood stains in the hallway, there were a number of both footwear impressions and footprint impressions. ^nm2zk  
The bloody footwear/footprint impressions led into the kitchen area of the house, and through the front living room towards the front door. ^e1ly8  
There were several very clear footprint impressions and footwear impressions left in the blood matrix in several locations in the house. ^jnu2q

The scene was processed methodically by the CSRT. ^0fyvg  
Blood splatter, blood cast off, and other types of blood evidence were documented, both as found initially, and then as various pieces of furniture were removed to fully reveal the blood evidence. ^o0-xs

A number of photographs were also taken of the blood footprints. ^2fakk  
The CSRT took a large number of swabs from various bloody areas of the home, and took a number of physical items into evidence. ^8inf4

[[./01 Kris Kern|Kris Kern]] of the Washington State Police, an expert in crime scene reconstruction and bloodstain pattern analysis, led the team that processed the home. ^7lpaa  
[[./01 Kris Kern|Kern]] also authored a detailed report outlining the sequencing of the brutal assault on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], the dynamic nature of the assault, and the dragging of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body to the bathtub. ^hjkhl

[[./02 Steve Stone|Steve Stone]], a forensic scientist at Washington State Police, examined some of the footwear impressions left in blood. ^47yij  
A type of shoe that police documented [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchasing on [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]] was "consistent" with leaving some of the prints at the scene. ^7oyzo  
Mr [[./02 Steve Stone|Stone]] also examined some bloodstain impressions on the bathtub. ^e2i54  
[[./02 Steve Stone|Stone]] found that the impressions in blood on the tub were "consistent" with a coverall type of suit that the police were able to document [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] buying on [[./2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]] and [[./2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013|2013-02-12 Tuesday February 12th 2013]]. ^vz0w7

[[./03 Sergeant Shelly Massey|Sergeant Shelly Massey]] of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was consulted by the [[./04 Bothell|Bothell]] Police Department in regards to the bloody footprints. ^ljoxo  
[[./03 Sergeant Shelly Massey|Sergeant Massey]] is an expert on "foot morphology". ^9tr8i  
[[./03 Sergeant Shelly Massey|Sergeant Massey]] examined photos of the bloody footprints, and compared them to known impressions of [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s feet, and found "support" for the hypothesis that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left the bloody footprints. ^l8ikf  
[[./03 Sergeant Shelly Massey|Sergeant Massey]]'s findings and methodology was the subject of a previous hearing to determine the need for a Frye hearing.

[[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Stanley Adams]], assistant medical examiner for Snohomish County responded to [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s home, and examined the body in situ prior to it being removed to the medical examiner's office. ^16-53  
During [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]], [[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] documented 12 sharp force injuries and 10 blunt force injuries to [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s head, face and neck. ^-5dpb  
[[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] also documented a number of injuries to both of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s arms that he termed "defensive wounds". ^2y1tt  
The injuries were photo documented per the usual protocol at [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]]. ^lcqh2

The significance of [[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]]' findings was, among other things, that two different weapons were used to kill [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^hw10w  
[[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] was shown a type of [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] that the police were able to document [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] purchasing on [[./2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012|2012-10-27 Sunday October 27th 2012]]. ^rk526  
[[./04 Dr Stanley Adams|Dr Adams]] opined that this type of weapon would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]. ^-s0h8

[[./05 Kathy Geil|Kathy Geil]], forensic scientist at Washington State Police, also examined photographs of the injuries and the [[./03 Mallet|mallet]], and indicated the [[./03 Mallet|mallet]] was "consistent" with the wound patterns documented on [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]] photos. ^ca0gh  
It is also apparent from looking at the location of the various wounds on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body that the sole intent of her assailant was to kill her. ^k8a71

The photographs of the [[./01 Autopsy|autopsy]] are probative and helpful in illustrating the ferocity of the attack on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], the nature of the injuries inflicted on her, in helping identify at least one of the weapons likely used to kill her, and the intent of her attacker.
