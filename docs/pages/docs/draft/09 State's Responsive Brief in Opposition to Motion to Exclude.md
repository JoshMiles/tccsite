[[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] was [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s lawyer during her dissolution proceedings with [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]. After [[./02 Commissioner|Commissioner]] Brudvik had made her initial rulings on Temporary Orders related to the divorce on [[./2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012|2012-08-03 Friday August 3rd 2012]], the parties and their respective lawyers went out into the hall to reduce [[./02 Commissioner|the Commissioner]]'s rulings to writing. ^jhnjt

While this was going on, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] and [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] disagreed on an issue relating to time with the [[./07 Children|children]] during the summer. According to attorney [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]], [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] got upset; and then fixed upon [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] what he described as an "incredibly angry" stare. [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] describes the stare as lasting approximately 5 seconds. [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] indicated in his written statement to police that the stare was something the like he had never seen in some 15 years of practise. The glare was concerning enough to [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]] that he asked [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] about it, and mentioned it to his staff. ^zeg12

The State would ask the Court to deny [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s motion to exclude this testimony from attorney [[./01 John Ely|John Ely]].
