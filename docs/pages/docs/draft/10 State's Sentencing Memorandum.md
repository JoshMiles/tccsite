Sentencing scheduled for [[./2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015|2015-02-23 Monday February 23rd 2015]], at 1:30pm. ^y3csb

This Court convicted [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] of Murder in the First Degree on [[./2015-02-04 Wednesday February 4th 2015|2015-02-04 Wednesday February 4th 2015]]. The Court heard the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict. ^swi5b

Murder in the First Degree is a level XV offense. ^16xqb

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] has no prior criminal history, thus having an offender score of "0". ^-ta2j
The standard range sentence for [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] is 240 to 320 months. ^bp8x6
However, the Court also found that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of offense. ^2o526
This finding adds 24 months to both the top and the bottom of the standard range, for an actual standard range of 264 to 344 months. ^un1zu

The Court also found that this was a crime of Domestic Violence. ^gl3rs
This offense also carries 36 months of community custody. ^1lnd1

The State's recommendation is that the Court sentence [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to the high end of the actual range, 344 months. ^-z-s9

In looking at the facts of this case it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence. ^grne2
This murder was no "heat of the moment" event. ^7ckb9
[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] chose a time when [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] would least likely be able to defend herself, and when it was least likely that anyone would witness any part of the act and attempt to intervene. ^pyze1

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] took multiple steps to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for police to find. ^p-bnk
Further, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] used his own [[./07 Children|children]] as props in his story to police, holding them forth as proof he did not venture out into the night and "kill the mother of his [[./07 Children|children]]". ^gq94k

[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s arrogance manifested itself in a belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned well enough he would be able to get away with murder. ^04ofs
It would appear, from all the evidence in the case, that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] approached this vicious attack like he would have any problem at work; this is, with enough thought and engineering anything could be managed. ^47qd7

The manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] planned the attack, and the manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s body in the bathtub demonstrates this. ^yn35i
[[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] believed he had thought of everything - coming under the cover of darkness, wearing protective gear, disposing of the various items used in the attack, and having a story he believed could not be not be disproved. ^p0yhj

Ultimately, however, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] was undone both by various items he did not account for, and by his own unravelling when his "post-Susann" life did not turn out as he anticipated. ^nryjr

The degree to which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s selfishness will impact the lives of [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]]'s family and his [[./07 Children|children]] is hard to overstate. ^h64ie

In an effort to keep his [[./07 Children|children]] from going with their mother to her native Germany, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] went to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her [[./07 Children|children]] and church. ^966aa

Because he feared that the [[./07 Children|children]] might be moved to Germany at some point, [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] has essentially orphaned them. ^a3u58
The grotesque manner in which [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] treated [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in the bathtub, speaks volumes as to the disdain he had for anyone's desires or wishes other than his own. ^uzxsh
The horrific scene that [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] left in blood at the home where his [[./07 Children|children]] lived would seem clear evidence [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] thought of no one but himself. ^8w53x

The cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] cannot be exaggerated. ^wdcrk
The Court saw the damage [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] inflicted on [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]], so it will not be belaboured here. ^ysb0p

However, the location of the injuries, the number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the placement of her in the bathtub once she was completely helpless demonstrates a single mindedness of purpose on [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s part. ^wytqp
The pain and horror that [[./01 Susann Smith|Susann Smith]] likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate. ^d7a-h

The State would request that the Court impose the high end of the actual standard range of 344 months. ^m10d7

The State would also ask that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]]'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions. ^wphno

The State would also ask the Court to order [[./01 Alan Smith|Alan Smith]] to have no contact with Kristine Hentschel, Johanna and Werner Hentschel for life. ^5yw-0

The State would also ask that the Court order no contact with either Noelani Smith and Felix Smith until they reach the age of 18, respectively. ^n708z
